BarronG510: realDonaldTrump The media is corrupt! We The People are fighting with you." 
We had a great day! HAPPY BIRTHDAY Barron- I love you! 
Wow, President Obama just landed in Cuba, a big deal, and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect 
Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there! 
gamzorz: megynkelly Dont worry Trump, They are losing thousands of viewers and money. Roger Ailes will be telling Megyn to stop" 
So the highly overrated anchor, megynkelly, is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show, but I can't fight back? Wrong! 
The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters! 
Why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES, are never blamed by media? SAD! 
Will be interviewed on ThisWeekABC this morning. Enjoy! 
GStephanopoulos: Whats realDonaldTrump's strategy to secure the GOP nomination? Ill talk to the Republican front-runner. ThisWeekABC."

Wow, CNN ratings are up 75 because it's "all Trump, all the time." The networks are making a fortune off of me! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Great to be back in Arizona!   
If crazy megynkelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show, her ratings would totally tank. She is so average in so many ways! 
Crazy megynkelly says I don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings. But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me! 
saneplanet: after tonight it is clear! Utah is      
TeamTrumpAZ: Check out "HANNITY EXCLUSIVE EVENT WITH TRUMP IN PHOENIX, AZ" Eventbrite" 
DonaldJTrumpJr: Honored to be in  with retired General Robert C. Oaks. We are so thankful for his support and endorsement here in SLC 
Ma1973sk: Actually, no FoxNews, megynkelly has a sick obsession with Trump. Every day, every show, trashing, negative, hate. 
AshleyEdam: It's great to see supporters like you along the way...watching Americans come together the past 8 months  
grammy620: 1st time I heard  I said "wow". I liked him! I then became a closet  fan. Today? He's the ONLY 1 I will vote for! 
Veteran4Trump: Vets For A Strong America Endorses Donald Trump for president; "We've Endorsed Him, We Believe In Him"  
WesleyRickard: Sheriff Joe Arpaio AZ Endorses Donald J Trump for President of the United States   
cmichaeld2004: Realistic Trump Poll Numbers translate to the 70 percentile range in a two-man race. Gee, what happened to that 30 ceiling 
ileanabarkus: nytdavidbrooks I totally agree! nytdavidbrooks is strictly conceptual and theoretical and has NO COMMONSENSE!" 
Thank you- New York! I love you!   
Landing in Phoenix now. Tomorrow's events will be amazing!  
Reading nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times is a total waste of time, he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him- dummy! 
While I have never met nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times, I consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits- he has no sense of the real world! 
Heading to Phoneix. Will be arriving soon. Tomorrow a big day. Tremendous crowds expected!   
Watching loudobbsnews- fantastic show! Has very interesting take on Paul Ryan. 
Just leaving Salt Lake City, Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions. Love Utah- will be back! 
Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri? 
I guess I have reached yet another "ceiling" - 49.7, with four people. My highest Reuters poll yet! Thank you! 
Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets! 
Everybody should boycott the megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick, amp; the most overrated person on tv. 
Thank you Arizona- I love you!   
Join me tomorrow!   
Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! 
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich amp; Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2 
Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who "choked" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me! 
Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary 
Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $1,000,000.00 from me. Remember, I said- NO! 
Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful! 
With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this? 
EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me. 
Senator LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about SenTedCruz  and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians! 
Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0! 
Join us in Salt Lake City, Utah- tonight!   
Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life! 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know. 
Highly overrated amp; crazy megynkelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn! 
Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine! 
See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday. 
Please explain to the dummies at the WSJ Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won, according to Drudge etc., all 11 of them! 
WSJ is bad at math. The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me! 
WSJ Editorial says "Clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.Trump's is 7,533,692"-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize 
The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem! 
Crazy megynkelly is now complaining that oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough! 
Great news that FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating 
Crazy megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win! 
Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad! 
I will be interviewed on The O'Reilly Factor this evening at 8 pm on the Fox News Channel. oreillyfactor 
Thank you, Missouri!  
Wow, just won Missouri! 
I am making a big speech the night of the FoxNews debate, but I wish everyone well. Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins! 
Thank you to the Governor of Florida, Rick Scott, for your endorsement. I greatly appreciate your support! 
In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida amp; I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$! 
Yesterday was amazing5 victories. Lyin Ted Cruz had zero. Things are going very well! 
Is this what we want for a President? 
RepTomMarino Great job on television this morning. Glad to have you on my side! 
FoxBusiness: RepTomMarino: I think realDonaldTrump can beat HillaryClinton. And I'm looking forward to Trump being president.

lucyric13835428: realDonaldTrump megynkelly That's funny, I switched to other media too, can't stand her" 
MaryEH428: RealBenCarson I thank God you are on board with realDonaldTrump to help him and us  Ty!!" 
Thank you Marco, I agree! 
I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at Mar-a-Lago for our great election victory. She is a winner! 
Thank you Illinois!    
Thank you, North Carolina!    
Watching other networks and local news. Really good night! Crazy megynkelly is unwatchable. 
Thank you, Florida!    
Thank you, Northern Mariana Islands!   
Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore. Talks about me at 43 but never mentions that there are four people in race. With two people, big amp; over! 
DumpFoxNews: FoxNews megynkelly If media wasn't so biased against Trump, he would've won all of the delegates. 
SCNAK45: megynkelly is trying so hard to bash realDonaldTrump it's ridiculous" Don't worry, everyone is wise to Crazy Megyn! 
J_Styborski: realDonaldTrump gregens21 BertShad FoxNews megynkelly Hayes is looking depressed as well. 
jsconlon11: BertShad Foxnews megynkelly I tried to give them a shot tonight, but they have the whole anti Trump cheerleading team." 
gregens21: BertShad FoxNews megynkelly She's choking on the results! Call her justifiable Kelly. Justifying everything she says." 
BertShad: Was going to watch Foxnews for the primary results but saw megynkelly - looks like  tonight" 
Word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon! 
A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false. 
I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again. 
In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary! 
Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now! 
Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down. 
  Florida Illinois Missouri North Carolina Ohio  
North Carolina lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400,000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN, WE WILL BRING BACK! 
Just in, big news- I have been declared the winner of the CNMI Rep Caucus with 72.8 of the vote! Thank you!   
Good morning Ohio! Some additional information from my daughter, IvankaTrump!   
Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.). 
Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists! 
I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL 
Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness! 
mazzei48: realDonaldTrump BrazielCarol FoxNews Listening to interview on replay of A Savage Nation  DONALD TRUMP !!!!!" Thanks. 
wh: WOW people are so misinformed on DonaldTrump character! Watch this video! Hillary and Bernie don't come close 
realwwshelton: loudobbsnews I believe that realDonaldTrump will be the big winner tomorrow." Thank you! 
BrazielCarol: FoxNews realDonaldTrump Who started this mess, the protesters of course . And media made it worse." 
Sadly, this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan. There is nothing nice about it!  
THANK YOU - Youngstown, Ohio! I love you! Get out amp;  tomorrow.  
Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio. I will bring them back!  
Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA, which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers! 
Leaving the great people of North Carolina. Amazing event. Heading to Tampa now!  
Look forward to being in Tampa this afternoon. Wonderful crowds. Thank you, Florida! 
We don't have a country- if we don't have borders.  Video: 
Just received from PeteRose_14. Thank you Pete!  on Tuesday Ohio!   
LYIN' TED 
The failing nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people! 
Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- amp; should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue. 
Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action! 
Thank you Kevin. With unification of the party, Republican wins will be massive! 
Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television, he only watches the GolfChannel 
Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying! 
Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours! 
alextrent4: It is repulsive that Trump was assaulted+politicians used that 2 further themselves+2 further victimize Trump! DISGUSTING!!" 
Wow, Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania, not enough signatures. Big problem! 
USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! 
Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words, education of your children from D.C. No way 
  Video: 
Just finished my second speech. 20K in Dayton amp; 25K in Cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd. Thanks- I love you, Ohio! 
It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians! 
The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact! 
We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio. No way to run a country! 
Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco, his State Chairman, amp; their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote. 
The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled!   
Thank you Dayton, Ohio! 20,000 supporters- largest in airport history!   
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
On my way to Dayton, Ohio. Will be there soon! 
The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio! 
Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil, they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud! 
Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico! 
The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America! 
I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam! Thank you for your support!  today!

I hear NBCNews / WSJ came out with another one of their phony polls. While I am leading, they are totally discredited after last S.C. poll 
The negative television commercials about me, paid for by the politicians bosses, are a total  When you watch, remember! 
Hawaii: Idaho: Mississippi: Michigan: 
  
  
  
  
Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it. Lindsey Graham ran for president, got ZERO, and quit! Why are they now spokesmen against me? Sad! 
Remember, I am the only one who is self-funding my campaign. All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests! 
Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience, work ethic and gravitas needed to be president. HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE! 
EricTrump: Wishing our father tremendous luck in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho amp; Hawaii today! Amazing father! Q" 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Thank you EricTrump! 
Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho amp; Hawaii: Get out to VOTE and join the movement today! Video: 
The Club for Growth is a very dishonest group. They represent conservative values terribly amp; are bad for America.

Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish! 
I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate, he is scamming Florida 
We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, who could not stop Obama (twice), ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of $'s in false ads! 
Lindsey Graham is all over T.V., much like failed 47 candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty, angry, jealous failures have ZERO credibility! 
Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run, brought him from 7 to 0 when he got out. Now nasty! 
How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook amp; Twitter. Watch! 
All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, the bandits that tell your pols what to do

CreativeXwalk: realDonaldTrump teaching the GOP how to lose four years ago was not enough. Now Romney wants to do it again." 
The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want to go to court. 98 approval rating by students. Easy win 
Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago? 
I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton. I am not a Mitt Romney, who doesn't know how to win. Hillary wants no part of "Trump" 
Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who, as a Senator, never even shows up to vote - worst record. Marco Rubio is a joke! 
I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party, while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement! 
Failed candidate Mitt Romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big "R" win! 
malski1954: I changed parties to vote for you, no one else measures up to you, The GOPe needs a reality check. Our country is at stake" 
Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected. Not a good messenger! 
Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio amp; Cruz.When you see them think of your puppet POLS 
Johnsmi01433966: The establishment doesn't like you because they can't control you and get you to lie to us and keep ripping us off."

Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. Check out his credit card scam, his house sale amp; his no show voting! 
The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.

Our law enforcement officers deserve our appreciation for the incredible job they do. Video: 
I will be making a big surprise announcement to the massive crowd assembled in Huntsville/Madison Alabama! Landing now!  
Phylis Schlafly: 'Marco Rubio Betrayed Us All' 
Little Marco Rubio treated America's ICE officers "like absolute trash" in order to pass Obama's amnesty. 
Little Marco Rubio gave amnesty to criminal aliens guilty of "sex offenses." DISGRACE! 
Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action.  
EmaGabi23: Rubio was kicking back on his $80k boat he bought with lobbyist money and claimed it was from book sale profit lol" 
Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida. The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic! 
Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician. 
Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by Harry R! A bad messenger for estab! 
As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow. 
Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk, no action pol! 
  
Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida, is set to be the "puppet" of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH! 
Making a big speech in Alabama today. So many people we had to move to a football stadium! Come and join us! 
I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover). I will also get states that no other Republican can get. 
While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins, Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.GROWING PARTY 
The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to "hit" Trump.I signed the pledge-careful 
While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil), word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio, the lightweight from Florida 
CharlesHodgson1: A lot more water after this bombshell, Rubio. You are an enemy of America. realDonaldTrump

THANK YOU Arkansas! Get out amp;  on Tuesday. We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE amp; GREAT AGAIN! 
Incredibly proud of my son EricTrump amp; his efforts on behalf of StJude in Memphis, TN. 
It was an honor to be the Grand Marshall- in the Salute to Israel Parade back in 2004. 
Just watched lightweight Marco Rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record. He is not as smart as Cruz, and may be an even bigger liar 
. was just banned by CNN - their loss! Tough, loyal guy. 
I started my business with very little and built it into a great company, with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing! 
I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication! 
Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people! 
I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz! 
Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit, no problem! 
I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why? 
NeilTurner_: realDonaldTrump There's only one real candidate, and it's you! Donors control the other candidates!  Thank you. 
I will be on foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. Will be talking about lightweight Marco Rubio and lying Ted Cruz! 
SassyPantsjj: Michigan GOP poll 2/24/2016 Trump 35.5 Rubio 15.0 Cruz 14.3 Kasich 12.8 Carson 8.3 realDonaldTrump" Wow!

itsblakec: realDonaldTrump Trump is a genius. Rubio and Cruz are not. I want a brilliant mind to run this country." 
donnieboysmith: realDonaldTrump in contrast to Rubio and Cruz you look like a giant. They look terribly weak" Thank you! 
What I would do on my first day in office.  Watch: 
Thank you Texas! 10,000 amazing supporters!   
Never let them see you sweat! 
Thank you for your support amp; friendship- Governor ChrisChristie!   
They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high amp; dry. Doesn't even show up for votes! 
Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown. 
Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor! 
Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material! 
Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed! 
Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made! 
Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit! 
Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. Loser! 
I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth, Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus, plus! 
WaltSeher: realDonaldTrump morg25016893 eventbrite yup 200 Polish immigrants were hired by his contractor not Trump"

All the online polls have me winning the debate. I really enjoyed the evening. Not easy, but good. 
  
Thank you!  Polls  
 
Thank you! WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  
Failed presidential candidate MittRomney was made to look like a fool by Senator Harry Reid amp; didn't release his tax returns until 9/21/12. 
THANK YOU!   
FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar! 
Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina, it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide! 
Thank you Illinois!  
Join me in Oklahoma tomorrow night!   
I'm going to do what MittRomney was totally unable to do- WIN! 
LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Schedule amp; tickets: 
Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous? 
Just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do w/ someones net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great! 
Why doesnt MittRomney just endorse marcorubio already. Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late now! 
Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope! 
Great new poll. Thank you Texas!   
ChatteringTeef: BornToBeGOP realDonaldTrump MittRomney hates to see Trump's success when he was so pathetic 
classyexplorer: ahernandez85a Romney is a pawn of the Establishment and has no individual thought process. He is jealous of Trump!" 
conservativevin: ahernandez85a Romney should have been a tough guy with Obama. He cowered and lost. BADLY! He's not relevant!" 
Stevekwebb: realDonaldTrump Love it! tedcruz is done. We need someone who is proven. realDonaldTrump will make America Great Again" 
Ausbiz: realDonaldTrump Trump is so impressive and no other politician has his passion amp; energy to  
HosierN: foxnewspolitics A vote for tedcruz or marcorubio is a vote for corruption, special interests and lobbyists. Trump for POTUS! 
ahernandez85a: realdonaldtrump Mr Tough Guy Romney should be backing Trump like Trump backed him last time  
Ted Cruz is lying again. Polls are showing that I do beat Hillary Clinton head to head. Check out Poll snd Q Poll. 
Texas, Georgia amp; many more VOTE EARLY! This is a movement!  VOTE VIDEO: 
GriceCindy: That's why we are angry. The Republican Establishment will not support you. You are who the American people want!" 
ddpick18: realDonaldTrump This Texan will be voting Trump March 1st. Cruz is a fake Texan!" 
RepChrisCollins Chris, thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement. I will not let you down! CNN 
When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear, I will get most of his votes - no problem! 
Why would Texans vote for "liar" Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada, lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently 
When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around, he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win! 
Ward_II: Oh great MittRomney is doing a SenatorReid on realDonaldTrump like losing the presidency wasn't enough  He's a fool 
Mitt Romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy 
The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters. That is how I got to 46. When others drop out, I will pick up more. Sad but true 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
In all of television- the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory-- was dopey KarlRove. He should be fired! 
I am in Virginia RegentU Presidential forum with Dr. Pat Robertson- beginning now! Watch here: 
I am self funding my campaign amp; don't owe anybody anything! I only owe it to the American people!  Watch: 
USATODAY Poll and QuinnipiacPoll say that I beat both Hillary and Bernie, and I havn't even started on them yet! 
Big defeat last night in Nevada for Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. KarlRove on FoxNews is working hard to belittle my victory. Rove is sick! 
MELANIATRUMP did great on television this morning. Poised, smart and strong, with a big heart - so much to offer. We are all proud of you!

Club for Growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars. I told them no and now they are doing negative ads. 
Great. Just reported on FoxNews that many people who supported JebBush are now supporting me. I knew that would happen, pundits didn't! 
Wow, great Ohio poll. Shows me leading by 5 points, beating K! 
Unlike the other Republican candidates, I will be in Nevada all day and night - I won't be fleeing, in and out. I love amp; invest in Nevada! 
Join us in Sparks, Nevada today!   
StevenMeyers11: Vogelsong1 EdRollins FoxNews Ed Rollins is the only one of those people that understands process amp; gets it right" 
I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers, way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past. 
jojo2foxy: TRUMP IS UNSTOPPABLE....HE IS WHAT COMMON SENSE AMERICANS WANT WHETHER REPUBLICAN, INDEPENDENT OR A REAGAN DEMOCRAT. 
Vogelsong1: EdRollins gets it. Was just on FoxNews explaining how Trump wins the general election." Thank you Ed! 
Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out amp; said no! 
Ted Cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD! 
Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked. 
Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration. 
THANK YOU LAS VEGAS, NEVADA!   
Join me live- now in Las Vegas, Nevada! We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE amp; GREAT AGAIN!   
Ted Cruz said on oreillyfactor that illegals sent out of country by my administration would come right back as citizens. Another lie-crazy!

I will be on seanhannity tonight- from Las Vegas, Nevada at 10pmE. Enjoy!   
Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad. 
Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy? 
Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support! 
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics! 
Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks! 
It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done. 
Thank you for your endorsement paulteutulsr!   Video: 
Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry! 
SandraR677582: FLTrumpTeam Florida starts early voting on March 5 extending to March 15. Absentee ballots have been sent out!  
ScotMReed: No matter what liar sleazeball rickwtyler says about tedcruz in Tennessee. We have early voting and realDonaldTrump has won. 
I hear the Rickets family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $'s against me. They better be careful, they have a lot to hide! 
1sonny12: KSmith233035 mitchellvii FLORIDIANS ARE UPSET BECAUSE RUBIO DID NOT DO WHAT HE PROMISED ONCE HE WAS ELECTED! VOTE TRUMP" 
gregusp61: You really rocked them hard in S.C. Rubio and Cruz were pummled. So glad Jeb is gone! Next no liar!" 
The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR, and Evangelicals do not like liars! 
I am in Las Vegas, at the best hotel (by far), Trump International. I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada!

Thank you South Carolina! 
A quote was read from a parody account last night on MSNBC re: Jeb.

South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands. Vote now (today), and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go! 
Carolyn82471448: WayneDupreeShow realDonaldTrump All aboard the Trump Train!"

Response to the Pope: 
I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar! 
FoxNews is changing their theme from "fair and balanced" to "unfair and unbalanced." But dying WSJ is worse.Their phony poll is a joke! 
Thank you South Carolina! Together, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  
  
Thank you America!  
New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly! 
I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
The just out USA Today National Poll, where I lead by big numbers, shows that in a head to head matchup, I beat both Hillary and Bernie. 
Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls, the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll. 
Join us tomorrow in Kiawah, South Carolina!    
THANK YOU AMERICA!   
Thank you Nevada!   
  
Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool, but it's far too late. 1 in Nevada! 
Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, LindseyGrahamSC, and just go home. 
FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative! 
I will beat Hillary easily, but Lindsey Graham says I won't, and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on? 
lindseygraham, who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on FoxNews. 
Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history! 
ChJLuc91: YomasterJon RichardTBurnett Scary how smoothly Cruz looks into the camera and lies about Trump, CANT be

Thank you kayleighmcenany for your nice words - great knowledge and style! We are doing really well in South Carolina. CNN donlemon 
Good2bqueen67: brithume megynkelly They're too lame to get it, Sir. When you win the election they'll get it." 
brithume thinks that when Republicans drop out of the race, someone will pick up ALL of that vote. The fact is I will get much of it! 
Explain to brithume and megynkelly, who know nothing, that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other R can! 
Will be interviewed by StephenAtHome tonight by phone- a late show first CBS colbertlateshow. Enjoy!

New South Carolina poll from PPP. Thank you!  
What a night! 10,000 amazing supporters in Greenville, South Carolina! THANK YOU! VOTE on Saturday!  
Thank you for your continued support!  
RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ:   
JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private "Eminent Domain" --- Just another clueless politician! 
Jeb used Eminent Domain amp; took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2) 
I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue amp; never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2) 
Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful! 
I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada 
Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother! 
Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't! 
Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you! 
Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists amp; special interests - the bosses! 
Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors amp; special ints 
Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy! 
This shows what a complete amp; total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts. Really? 
autumnandews08: realDonaldTrump JebBush Jeb is incompetent and will lose, don't waste your energy on that cry baby!" 
Even though every poll, Time, Drudge etc., has me winning the debate by a lot, FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke! 
jeffpaine: realDonaldTrump you crushed the debate! Thank you! 
  
Hey glennbeck- see how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing!  
 
All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge, TIME, etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest! 
How can JebBush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the  stage with $150M? I am the only one who can! 
Thank you! I miss my father. 
Lightweight JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie!  
On the way to the  with my wonderful wife MelaniaTrump. 
Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts! 
Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot amp; I hold liberal positions. LIES! 
Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington amp; Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud! 
The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY! 
Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.

Totally unauthorized, do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn.   
The RNC, which is probably not on my side, just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC. 
Now an additional 600-700 jobs in America (2,000) being eliminated for move to Mexico- via Hartford Courant.

Word is that little Morty Zuckermans NYDailyNews loses more than $50 million per year---can that be possible? 
When little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit? Will happen soon. 
11,000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5,000 outside. Will be back! 
I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE amp; GREAT AGAIN!  
 
Millions of $'s of false ads, paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater SenTedCruz and sleepy JebBush, are now running in S.C. 
copyover2001: realDonaldTrump Do Americans really want a Canadian-born president? First non native born in history?" 
by tedcruz good I want to see the court decide what I was always told "natural born" means - born on American soil" 
hillx123: tedcruz you have just been put on notice realDonaldTrump We Stand with you...  Thankyou. 
Last time lightweight JebBush tried to knock off marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time, he is out! 
If TedCruz doesnt clean up his act, stop cheating, amp; doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen. 
Lightweight JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad! 
After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me, they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect amp; ill-informed ads. 
Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution, which naturally, they did not get. 
You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary. 
The failing NYDailyNews, destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman, is preparing to close and save face by going online. It's dead! 
NEVADA! Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican. Visit: Message from IvankaTrump: 
How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest? 
Lying Cruz put out a statement, Trump amp; Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage." Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3? 
Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech. Do you think he will be this tough on Putin amp; others? 
THANK YOU- Baton Rouge, Louisiana! WE will   
Just landed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in. Wow!  
Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ RealBenCarson. How can he preach Christian values? 
truthinvest: CNN tedcruz realDonaldTrump Ted Cruz is the definition of sleaze. Just ask RealBenCarson" 
Heading to Baton Rouge, Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon.   
We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching! 
Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance! 
He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT 
MarkHalperin showed a focus group on Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize! 
Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability! 
There are no buyers for the worthless NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser! 
I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local! 
THANK YOU- Clemson, South Carolina!   
HARyder: Which is it realDonaldTrump ?Are you planning on getting rid of Common Core or keeping it? Get rid of it fast. 
I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core. 
Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd! 
So funny, Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment! 
Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today. 
Like the worthless NYDailyNews, looks like politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money, no cred! 
Worthless NYDailyNews, which dopey Mort Zuckerman, is desperately trying to sell, has no buyer! Liabilities are massive! 
Dopey Mort Zuckerman, owner of the worthless NYDailyNews, has a major inferiority complex. Paper will close soon! 
MarkHalperin: My report card grades for the 2 New Hampshire winners: DonaldTrump A: v strong energy/close. BernieSanders B+: went too long 
Thank you to the people of New Hampshire, I love you! Now, off to South Carolina. 
Thank you, New Hampshire! Departing with my amazing family now!   
We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security. 
We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare! 
ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our "leader" - If I win it will be a very different story,with very fast results

The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great! 
No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so! 
I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain! 
Remember JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader! 
Thank you, New Hampshire!  
Thank you, New Hampshire!    Voting questions? 
   
Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign, he says he would end super PACs. Sad!

Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of  and very weak on illegal immigration. 
Thank you for your support at this mornings Town Hall- in Salem, New Hampshire.   
Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate! 
My two wonderful sons, Don and Eric, will be on foxandfriends at 7:02 - now! Enjoy. 
So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
I am in New Hampshire having a great time! Loved the  last night! Everybody enjoy the Super Bowl.

oreillyfactor KarlRove- as per the show, an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone. 
 KarlRove amp; oreillyfactor discuss what Ted Cruz did to the great people of Iowa- as they went to vote. 
Thank you billoreilly amp; KarlRove. Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa, with each candidate moving up one notch. 
Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat! 
THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock, Arkansas tonight! A record crowd of 12K.  
Stop the assault on American values. Stand w/ Trump to   
Thank you New Hampshire!   
Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies." 
Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against  repeal and replace! 
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud! 
This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote.  
I will be interviewed on greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! FoxNews 
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. 
And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie! 
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud 
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. 
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. 
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! 
Great job on donlemon tonight kayleighmcenany cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! CNN 
On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!   
Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!

I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it! 
I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd 
The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history! 
Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz amp; Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor 
My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice

If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000. 
By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS. 
Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal amp; replace. He lies! 
Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam! 
Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN! 
I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State! 
bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed Cruz. foxandfriends 
bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself.Phony foxandfriends 
bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz! 
The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad! 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Looking forward to a great weekend in Iowa!   Tickets: 
oreillyfactor The people of Iowa love the fact that I stuck up for my rights, as I will do for the U.S. Also got $6,000,000 for our VETS! 
FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS. 
Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator is endorsing Canada Ted! 
BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected? greta 
The great State of Nebraska can do much better than BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols. 
The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

snoozinglion1: Full Speech: Donald Trump Campaign Rally in Pella IA (1-23-16) via YouTube One of his best ever" 
Love making correct predictions. National Review is over. review-doomed 
Word is that crying GlennBeck left the GOP and doesn't have the right to vote in the Republican primary. Dumb as a rock. 
Serious doubt in Illinois as to whether or not Cruz can run for President. First of many challenges. 
Just left a great event in Pella. Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine, Iowa. 
I will be on FOX with the great JudgeJeanine tonight at 9pm EST! Enjoy!  
williebosshog such an honor to get your endorsement. You are a fantastic guy! It will not be forgotten. Don and Eric say hello! 
Heading now to Pella, Iowa. Big crowd! Remember, Trump is a big buyer of Pella windows. See you soon! 
For the great people of Iowa, find your  location at So important to vote!  
Just left Sioux Center, Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house- overflow! 
A wonderful story on Iowa voters by arappeport of the NYTimes. 
Failing GlennBeck lost all credibility. Not only was he fired  FOX, he would have voted for Clinton over McCain. 
Based on MegynKelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate. 
Heading to Sioux County, Iowa, where the crowd is amazing. Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction. Make America Great Again! 
Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big. Because he was born in Canada and was, until recently, a Canadian citizen, many believe he cannot run! 
I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates. All bull, politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen! 
AnnCoulter has been amazing. We will win and establish strong borders, we will build a WALL and Mexico will pay. We will be great again! 
I will be the greatest job-producing president in American history.   
noamscheiber: Dow down almost 2000 pts since start of year, but still outperforming Wall Street's investment in Jeb. JEB wants Common Core 
LukeBrinker: One year from today. 
I am in Iowa. Will be making two speeches today. Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast. Enjoy the beauty of the storm! 
TheSouthwasRite: NRO cancelling my subscription- you people are idiots. realDonaldTrump WILL be our next President.   
A wonderful article by a writer who truly gets it. I am for the people and the people are for me.  
Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. amp; is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure amp; never sold off assets. 
Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for  He could be Canadian Prime Minister. 
Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet! 
The only reason irrelevant GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad! 
BrentBozell, one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that? 
Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin. 
Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada? 
Rush Limbaugh is great, tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy! Thanks Rush!  
The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. Really dishonest reporting. 
Just received the new Fox poll. Thank you, America!  
Wow! New National Zogby Poll just out:.TRUMP 45. CRUZ 13. RUBIO 8. Big numbers. 
Leaving Nevada now for Iowa. Things are looking good - great new polls! 
New National GOP Zogby Poll   
"National Black Republican Association Endorses Donald J. Trump"   
New Reuters poll! Thank you!   
The dying NRO National Review has totally given up the fight against Barrack Obama. They have been losing for years. I will beat Hillary! 
Wow! This might be my highest  yet! Thank you to my opposition- you are totally ineffective amp; have been for years! 
WhiteGenocideTM: realDonaldTrump Poor Jeb. I could've sworn I saw him outside Trump Tower the other day! 
Lisa_Milicaj: Truth be told, I never heard of The National Review until they "tried" to declare war on you. No worries, you got my vote!" 
After spending $89 million, JebBush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls. He is ashamed to use the name "Bush" in ads. Low energy guy! 
The failing NRO National Review Magazine has just been informed by the Republican National Committee that they cannot participate in debate 
MiamiNewTimes: Poll: Trump has more support in Florida than Rubio and Bush combined. 
CyberCiety:  clarified how  is used to interpret meaning of   
D:  Washington Post: Constitutionally speaking,  simply isnt eligible to be president 
Highly respected Constitutional law professor Mary Brigid McManamon has just stated, "Ted Cruz is not eligible to be President." Big problem 
TruBluMajority:  calls Cruz "constitutional hypocrite" on WBUR pbsgwen charlierose jaketapper 
 eligibility to be President not settled law, says Cruz' Constitutional Law Professor,

BornToBeGOP: realDonaldTrump No sleep for the  
realOllieTaylor: Isn't it time we had a president? Let goofy Glen keep Canada Cruz who can't win. The American people have Trump!" 
Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain, but without it we wouldn't have roads, highways, airports, schools or even pipelines. 
The late, great, William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize, the dying National Review! 
Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize, but not how to lead. 
National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad! 
Thank you, Iowa!     
Why does Greta have a fired Bushy like dummy, John Sununu on- spewing false info? I will beat Hillary by a lot, she wants no part of Trump. 
  
Thank you, New Hampshire!  
Thank you!  
Thank you, Iowa!  
Happy birthday to my friend, the great jacknicklaus - a totally special guy! 
New Day on CNN treats me very badly. AlisynCamerota is a disaster. Not going to watch anymore. 
Low energy candidate JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. Millions spent on me. He should go home and relax! 
Sad sack JebBush has just done another ad on me, with special interest money, saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL. But he can't beat me. 
So sad that CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma. Dishonest reporting!

NeilTurner_: You're the only candidate we can trust, other candidates are controlled by their donors!  
Wacko glennbeck is a sad answer to the SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted. Glenn is a failing, crying, lost soul! 
AnnCoulter: Trump destroyed Hillary amp; Sanders moved in. But he didn't destroy her, Trump did. So true! 
New CNN/WMUR New Hampshire poll just released. Thank you!   
Bob Dole Warns of Cataclysmic Losses With Ted Cruz, and Says Donald Trump Would Do Better via New York Times:

Palins brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump tower, said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith amp; Freedom Coalition. 
Wow, the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that "Ted Cruz must be defeated." Big shoker! People do not like Ted. 
A true honor to receive the endorsement of John Wayne's daughter....read: 
In the just released SC poll I increased my lead by 4 points since last poll by same firm. Up by 14! Cruz dropped 3. 
Thank you for your strong testimony when welcoming me to Liberty University, yesterday- JerryJrFalwell. 
Thank you Georgia! I appreciate all of your support.  
FreeJesseJames- Just read your complete statement. You are an amazing guy amp; I really appreciate your words amp; support. I will see you soon! 
On my way to Iowa- just received new national poll numbers. Thank you!   
Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories. 
Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people, including Karl Rove, losers-true! I never called my friend HowardStern a loser- hes a winner! 
tedcruz Conflicting Stances on Birthright Citizenship [14th Amendment] Gives  credit. 
Wow, new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down - he is a nervous wreck! 
TheBrodyFile great job on AC360. Thank you for the very smart and kind words! 
.TheBrodyFile Exclusive: realDonaldTrump Says He Will Protect Evangelicals Better Than tedcruz   
I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt! 
Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks! 
I loved being at Liberty University today! Record setting crowd, unbelievable people! Thank you Jerry and Becki! 
We launched a new series of  videos via Facebook. A new topic everyday! Watch: 
A great morning with everyone LibertyU! Thank you! Off to New Hampshire now.  
Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd.  
Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us

pbralick: BenKissel great on greggutfeld GregGutfeldShow JoNosuchinsky too" Thank you Ben for your nice comments on debate! 
I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money, not controlled. Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses. 
Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S., or we won't have a country anymore! 
Big announcement in Ames, Iowa on Tuesday! You will not want to miss this rally!  
Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S., rather Airbus! 
In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others! 
Interesting read from Peggy Noonan. 
Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about amp; demeaning? 
Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, amp; $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite 
Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you! 
Greatly dishonest of TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form amp; not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St 
When will TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him. 
Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics! 
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage? 
Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes. 
Great new numbers. Thank you!   
Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him! 
Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks? 
Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate. 
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there! 
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer! 
Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable 
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so 
More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct. 
FrankLuntz is a total clown. Has zero credibility! FoxNews megynkelly 
oreillyfactor please explain to the very dumb and failing glennbeck that I supported John McCain big league in 2008, not Obama!

Top searched candidate by state, as seen in the  media filing center. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush. 
Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O.

TheBrodyFile: "Trump's appeal to evangelicals is real"  
United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win! 
Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures amp; images. We are weak. I will NOT forget! 
Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails  virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does andersoncooper put him on? 
Why does CNN amp; andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show? 
EricTrump- unbelievable job on  with greta. That was better than I could do!

THANK YOU, IOWA! Highly respected OANN GravisMarketing poll just released.

My nomination would increase voter turnout.    
Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue! 
johnkurkosky: Carolde The_Lady_Colors DRJAMESCABOT TamiDurling AceofSpadesHQ THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT AMERICAS FUTURE, VOTE TRUMP" 
Thank you for your support last night, Iowa!      
Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW! 
Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters! 
The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast! 
Just found out that tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great. 
The  speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch! 
The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia.  
New CBS poll.  
Another new Iowa poll just released. Thank you!   
Such a serious problem for Ted amp; the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem.

So professional of ABC news to throw out the failing UnionLeader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive, highly unethical! 
Great job on Fox this morning KatiePavlich. I am sending out for your book immediately. Thank you very much! 
Congratulations to my friend TheSlyStallone on winning a  A wonderful guy- who has created something special- well deserved! 
Why does ThisWeekABC w/ GStephanopoulos allow a hater amp; racist like tavissmiley to waste good airtime? ABC can do much better than him! 
Thank you to our law enforcement officers!   
Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher! 
UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH. 
This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed. 
If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isnt questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who cant win. 
I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. 
Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch... 
Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!

I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in! 
I'm protesting the UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved! 
(2/2) David brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal! Read it! 
(1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.

On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it! 
Not good news for Jeb Bush 
Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!

We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable! 
I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont. It will be wild! 
Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on TheView. We love Barbara! 
The TheView ABC, once great when headed by BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad! 
Hillary and her friends! 
Weak amp; ineffective JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising! 
I have an idea for JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it! 
SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now amp; seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!

I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted! 
Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the Samp;P last year, plunging 46. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott. 
The failing UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate! 
Do you believe that UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received: 
I will be on wolfblitzer for a CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET.

Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.

Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!

Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate. 
Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening. 
MMMDigits: Well done  display of Southern pride and hospitality at realDonaldTrump event. Fired up and ready to go!!" 
namusca: realDonaldTrump EricTrump DiamondandSilk  is much better than any rock concert! He knows how to fill a stadium." 
Thank you   Remember this night amp; spread the word to get out amp;  
Granite_Hope: brandonstinney How can you deny this fact.HillaryClinton and BarackObama are the two people who made  a big problem" 
Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally. Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. Will be an amazing evening! 
Heading to Biloxi, Mississippi. Massive crowds expected. Thank you for your support!  
Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.! 
When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$! 
I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women! 
Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better! 
Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant! 
JebBush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance! 
JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads! 
Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night. Look forward to it! 2015 IN PHOTOS: 
 amp; together we will  THANK YOU for your support! 
Thank you so much to for naming me the 2015 Man of the Year. This is indeed a great honor for me! 
The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped! 
codyraymille: I have never been interested in politics but because of you I want to get my political science degree.  Great! 
I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive! Look forward to it.

sprinklermanus: CNN realDonaldTrump they're spending millions but you're still going to win - go Donald Trump" 
jallenaip: Hillary said she was in a "Fog of War" as explanation for the lies about Benghazi. No fog allowed in WH. Vote Trump POTUS!" 
Happy New Year from  Thank you to my great family for all of their support. 
 
HAPPY NEW YEAR amp; THANK YOU! 
I will be on FoxNews live, with members of my family, at 11:50 P.M. We will ring in the New Year together! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO, FINALLY, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN! 
Do you believe that The State Department, on NEW YEAR'S EVE, just released more of Hillary's e-mails. They just want it all to end. BAD! 
THANK YOU ILLINOIS! Let's not forget to get family amp; friends- out to VOTE IN 2016! 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, DonaldJTrumpJr! Very proud of you!  
I would feel sorry for JebBush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me

InsideGym: The Most Influential U.S. Gymnasts Of All Time: NastiaLiukin ShawnJohnson ASAQ_3" Fantastic Shawn 
People ask, "why do you tweet and re-tweet to millions about JebBush when he is so low in the polls?" Because of his big $ hit ads on me!

A GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
I predict that dying UnionLeader newspaper, which has been run into the ground by publisher "Stinky" Joe McQuaid, will be dead in 2 years! 
A lovely letter from the daughter of the late great John Wayne. Our country could use a John Wayne right now. 
Great poll- thank you Nevada!

Thank you Hilton Head, South Carolina! SCTeamTrump  
I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed RichLowry on television lately, and he was terrific hosting seanhannity 
Joe McQuaid deucecrew) is desperately trying to sell the UnionLeader. It's a loser, and my comments haven't helped him much. 
The dying UnionLeader newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out! 
TruthisAll1: realDonaldTrump CharlesHurt seanhannity Good morning, Mr. Trump. You're so AWESOME.  
bfb123456: trumpiowa PlaysTrumpCard realDonaldTrump WOW! FANTASTIC!. WHO KNEW AMERICANS WERE SO SMART? GREAT TO KNOW WE'RE so smart" 
hammetjohn: DonaldTrump - How do u do it Donald. No one could keep up with u at your pace. Shows how hard u will work for us as President" 
videosigninc: realDonaldTrump Keep the momentum going Mr. Trump. All the best to you for the New Year. Make America Great Again !" Thanks 
Hashtag1USA: realDonaldTrump what do you think of Jeb cancelling his Iowa rally last night ? I went, he didn't! 
Iowa was fantastic last night, amazing crowd and people. I'm now in Florida, getting ready to go to South Carolina. Big crowd, very exciting 
CharlesHurt You were great on seanhannity last night. Thanks for the nice words. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
THANK YOU Council Bluffs, Iowa! The silent majority, is silent no more!   
Joe McQuaid deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets---very unethical. 
The great people of New Hampshire, who I love, are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper. 
Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate! 
New  Thank you America!   
I hope TGowdySC does better for Rubio than he did at the  hearings, which were a total disaster for Republicans amp; America! 
We need a real President! 
Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs, Iowa, later today. Despite weather, rally is on -- will be fantastic!  
So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million amp; done. Run country my way! 
My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C. 
"Minorities line up behind.....Donald Trump"   
I will be interviewed on the TODAYshow at 7:00 A.M. Talking about the state of the race for president, and more. Enjoy! 
BillAtlantaGA: realDonaldTrump russgrand JebBush agreed. You destroyed him with only $250k 43" 
LandmanMarius: realDonaldTrump russgrand JebBush Word on street is that JebBush mother is voting realDonaldTrump" So cute! 
jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on FoxNews - he really gets it! 
russgrand: JebBush We had your brother and Father who were a disaster in office..do us a favor and drop out in favor of realDonaldTrump" 
Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible, failed badly, and was called a racist! 
shawgerald4: realDonaldTrump your kids all love you and so does America :]

Thank you- Nashua, New Hampshire!     
Thank you!  
Thank you to a  supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. Video: 
Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double amp; triple them, a disaster! 
Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few, and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now! 
Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX! 
The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no effective raise in years. BAD 
If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong! 
BornToBeGOP: realDonaldTrump We need a real President to get things done, and that's why we want you!" Thank you. 
Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST! 
Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid! RNC 
KevJames91: realDonaldTrump JebBush ananavarro secupp CNN 
isabellegirlxo: realDonaldTrump JebBush ananavarro secupp CNN Ana is an illegal who needs to be deported" No, she's just incompetent 
BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime, said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie! 
DavidSadler2525: realDonaldTrump What's going on in VA? What's the GOP doing? They will lose the state because of the RNC! 
Why are JebBush flunkies ananavarro and secupp, two of the dumbest people in politics, always on the CNN panels..and yet Poll:Trump 39 
The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change! 
R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW! 
It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD! 
LegacyRealtorsJ: You will come out tops Mr Trump. You are sincere, genuine, hard working, honest and willl DO WHAT YOU PROMISE THE PEOPLE 
JimVitari: realDonaldTrump CAC8438 we need the change Trump is going to make, not the change Obama did by ruining the country" 
CAC8438: He supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that Trey Gowdy is going to campaign with him. 
mitchellvii: My prediction on the Trey Gowdy endorsement of Rubio is that it will do nothing for Rubio and finish Gowdy." 
mitchellvii: Face it, Trey Gowdy failed miserably on Benghazi. He allowed it to drag out and in the end, let Hillary get away with murder. 
Sir_Max: andreajmarkley: Rubio finally gets an endorsement  from  loser Gowdy   via dailyne 
I will be interviewed on foxandfriends at 8:00. Will be talking about Hillary and far more interesting subjects. Enjoy! 
I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina! 
Thank you!  
Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate! 
greta: If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the  of uninsured is still large,Obamacare is a failure since so expensive 
A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders! 
  Story: 
Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE! 
The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix it 
The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21), now say I won't beat Hillary. 
chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary! 
CNN just announced that TRUMP was  story of 2015. Totally meaningless, however, if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again! 
deedeegop: Thank u Mr. Trump, I look forward to when u are elected next President of the United States  So nice! 
JodiL792: You know what's making my Christmas Great, Family/food/friendsamp;YOU! I HAVE MY TRUMP SHIRT ON W/HOPE IN MY HEART for America" 
Jacobsac2015: FoxNews Thank you for your tweet today on Christmas. Can't wait to see you as President, Mr. Trump. You are awesome." 
ClassySnobbb: realDonaldTrump FoxNews I'm reading  Best book ever. Thank you! 
When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say "we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never! 
Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly! 
Remember when failed candidate JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3. 
We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics! 
deedeesorvino was GREAT today on FoxNews She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more! 
Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done! 
danielhalper Great job on CNN today. Very wise indeed! 
HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps NBC will do better next year-but doubt it! 
YesMrGilbert: NBCNightlyNews HallieJackson should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story" True, a total distortion of the facts! 
I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
meetthepress and chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new CNN Poll where I am at 39, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck! 
Why isn't chucktodd using the much newer CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better! 
Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time! 
Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly 
Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill! 
Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past JebBush in the new CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3, I'm at 39. Stop throwing your money down the drain! 
In the ridiculous JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD! 
Poor JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs! 
classyexplorer: gatewaypundit Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACE...Trump is leading Cruz 39 to 18...Big Detail 
A great Christmas movie amp; perfect   Story: 
ihatematt: realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal." 
ihatematt: realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal." Good question! 
Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity 
Merry Christmas amp; Happy Holidays!   
Hillary, when you complain about "a penchant for sexism," who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL! 
It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media. New CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead 
Why does FoxNews give KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump 
FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out CNN Poll. All negative! 
The washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on  today did a nasty cartoon attacking tedcruz kids. Bad 
The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING!   
The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card. 
  
Thank you America! Together- we will  
Big news just out - NEW CNN POLL TRUMP 39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18 CARSON 10 RUBIO 10 
We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again! 
It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad! 
When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics! 
  
Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! TRUMP 37 CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge! 
For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged," bc  is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest  
NPR's NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls."  
Once again,  is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly. 
Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic! 
Watching CNN and consider secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased! 
Women defy media narrative, love Trump at packed Michigan rally. VIDEO: 
schoremis1: JebBush The Donald should've been named Man of the Year. He dominates the polls, news, talk shows amp; social media. MAGA!" 
qbeacademy: Well I'm at 42 and your at 3 .You know Jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage. Classic" 
JebBush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around, incoherent. 
Why doesn't JebBush, in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate? 
Will JebBush, in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate? 
JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. Will never work! 
Weak and low energy JebBush, whose campaign is a disaster, is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.

HerschelWalker, thanks for your support- it is very much appreciated! 
Getting ready to leave for Michigan - will be an amazing evening! See you there. 
Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about "the video" of me being used by ISIS. There is no video. 
Thanks AndreaTantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts. Big progress is being made. Keep up the great work! 
A suicide bomber has just killed U.S. troops in Afghanistan. When will our leaders get tough and smart. We are being led to slaughter! 
DRUDGE_REPORT: UPDATE: ISIS jihadists stole 'tens of thousands' of blank passports... Here we go!

Getting ready to go to the great State of Michigan. Big crowd tonight. Make America Great Again! 
Just out: TRUMP GOP DEBATE - 18,000,000. CLINTON DEMOCRAT DEBATE - 6,700,000. And they were on major network vs. cable! 
Hillary said with respect to ISIS, "we are finally where we need to be." Do we want 4 more years of incompetent leadership? MAGA! 
I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video. 
Hillary said at debate ISIS is "going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst." She made up story-want apology! 
Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant. I sold it 6 months ago for a record price. This would never have happened! 
msully65: Tell this knitwit SpeakerRyan, the ppl want realDonaldTrump, not him or his choice for President! Thts why Trump has 40" 
drdoucette:  DonaldTrump must be overjoyed that as soon as he sells the pageant it goes off the rails. We need you Mr Trump 
JebBush today said he didn't want to be the front-runner, he would rather be where he is now, 2. That is the talk of a loser, can't win! 
Great poll out of Illinois! Thank you!   
Themyamccurry: Where's realDonaldTrump when you need em?  
MissUniverse final 3 on now. Great people, great new owner IMG. WATCH. 
My friend, AriEmanuel of IMG, bought the Miss Universe pageants from me and they are on tonight on  Tune in! 
It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night. Not very presidential! 
Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore, Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD! 
JebBush was terrible on Face The Nation today. Being at 2 and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence. A basket case! 
We need a  with great strength amp; stamina. Hillary does not have that.  
blueeyd2020: JebBush reminds me now of BobbyJindal but no one cares Jeb! You lost your chance.  realDonaldTrump"

Thank you America! FoxNews post-debate poll with +/- from previous poll.   
Thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa!  
President Obama spends so much time speaking of the so-called Carbon footprint, and yet he flies all the way to Hawaii on a massive old 747. 
See, Sanders backed Hillary on E-mails at the debate, hurting himself, and then she threw him under the bus (but failed). Disloyal person!

The last thing our country needs is another BUSH! Dumb as a rock! 
JebBush has embarrassed himself amp; his family with his incompetent campaign for President. He should remain true to himself. 
  
Weak amp; ineffective JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising! 
I have an idea for JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name amp; dont be ashamed of it! 
MelindaDC Dont misrepresent in order to make a point. I was always tough on ISIS--as youll find out after I get elected.

ConradMBlack, what an honor to read your piece. As one of the truly great intellects amp; my friend, I won't forget! 
 
.  was great as a political analyst on FoxNews. He knows far more than football. Thanks for the nice words Joe! 
I won every debate so far according to all debate polls including DRUDGE_REPORT, TIME Slate and more. Too bad dopey megynkelly lies! 
Between Iraq war monger krauthammer, dummy KarlRove, deadpan GeorgezWill, highly overrated megynkelly, among others, FoxNews not fair! 
I am in Trump International Hotel, Las Vegas, getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight. Look forward - hope I get treated fairly! 
I wonder if megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. No matter how well I do - bad! 
megynkelly is very bad at math. She was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and Cruz in the new Monmouth Poll 41to14. 
megynkelly, the most overrated anchor at FoxNews, worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. She said 15! 
Why isn't anyone using the CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead. They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).Dishonest press 
Isn't it amazing that CNN paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll, which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13, 33 to 20 - then doesn't use it 
Wow, I just had two very good Iowa polls and a phenomenal just out National Poll from ABC washingtonpost - 38. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Thank you for your support!

I was disappointed that Ted Cruz would speak behind my back, get caught, and then deny it. Well, welcome to the wonderful world of politics! 
I did interview with Chris Wallace of FoxNews in order to be fair. He then puts on Rove, Lane and Will, three Trump bashers, to discuss. 
TheProdigy3D: Everyone vote for realDonaldTrump and no he did not pay me for this endorsement."

Tom Ridge is a failed 'Bushy' amp; PA Governor. Him amp; his friend KarlRove shouldn't be allowed to do their bias commentary- nobody listens!

The numbers at the nytimes are so dismal, especially advertising revenue, that big help will be needed fast. A once great institution-SAD! 
So, since the people at the nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade, why do people care what they write. Incompetent! 
The dopes at the nytimes bought the Boston Globe for $1.3 billion and sold it for $1.00. Their great old headquarters-gave it away! So dumb 
The nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control. With unfunded liabilities-big trouble!

Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete amp; total dud! 
John Kasich fell right into President Obamas trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame! 
Doesnt help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else - hes almost last. 
John Kasich ad guy wanted to work for me, but his proposal was a rip off  I said NO! Now ripping Kasich. 
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easyhe came in dead last! 
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart! 
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun! 
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I dont want to waste my money. 
John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic! 
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me. 
Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign amp; debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me. 
The legendary Barbara Walters interviews Melania Trump and me on a special this Friday night at 10:00 on ABC. Don't miss it! 
Thank you Worcester, Massachusetts!  
Just the beginning amp; it is going to get worse. Rates amp; deductibles are so high nobody is going to be able to use it. 
Has anybody read this story about Marco Rubio - devastating! 
I told you! Premiums are soaring!   
Thank you (Chris) TheFix. I have great respect for professionals that are willing to report so honestly amp; fairly. 
  
Thank you for your support! Together we can   
The POLICE in Paris did a fantastic job. Very brave - not easy! 
A great review of my Aberdeen course by prestigious GolfMonthly. Some say greatest ever built. TrumpScotland 
Everyone is now saying how right I was with illegal immigration amp; the wall. After Paris, theyre all on the bandwagon. 
We need new leadership- fast! 
I skipped a speech given years ago at Mar-a-Lago by dopey GeorgeWill because hes BORINGhe never forgot! 
Dopey GeorgeWill, a big proponent of the Iraq War and other catastrophes, doesnt like me very much. That means I win! 
Broken down political pundit GeorgeWill, who is wrong almost all of the time, should be thrown off FoxNews. Boring and totally biased! 
Eight Syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the U.S. ISIS maybe? I told you so. WE NEED A BIG amp; BEAUTIFUL WALL! 
Ben Carson is being severely criticized for being incapable of understanding foreign policy be one of his top consultants. Not good!

I will be interviewed by seanhannity tonight at 10:00 on FoxNews . Much, much, much to talk about! 
Melania and I just had interview with the legendary BarbaraJWalters. Watch  this Friday. Tonight we talk ISIS WNTonight 
AP is doing very badly. I can say from experience their reporting is terrible amp; highly inaccurate. Sadly, they are now irrelevant! 
One of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great AP. They have lost their way and are no longer credible. 
What is our President doing? 
"GOP Voters Trust Donald Trump to Keep Our Country Safe" 
Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country. Who knows who they are - some could be ISIS. Is our president insane? 
I, along with almost everyone else, have so little confidence in President Obama. He has a horrible attitude-a man who is resigned to defeat 
So many great polls like Reuters - big leads everywhere. New Hampshire really special! We will win big and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Thank you Tennessee!  
Just received a copy of SarahPalinUSA new book -- a great read! Sarah is a terrific person.

Discussing  with EricBolling on FoxNews back on 10/3/2015.  
Will be landing in Knoxville, Tennessee shortly - tremendous crowd expected. It's all very simple, we want to  
Republicans must stop listening to dopes like KarlRove who still insists Mitt Romney won the last election. Think big amp; think strong! 
Wow, Macys shares are down more than 40 this year. I never knew my ties amp; shirts not being sold there would have such a big impact! 
Interesting article from highly respected Wayne Allyn Root 
Remember, I was the one who said attack the oil (ISIS source of wealth) a long time ago. Everyone scoffed, now they're attacking the oil. 
SarahPalinUSA: From St. Patrick's Cathedral, NYC: blessings, prayers and heartfelt concern for those in Paris. 
StreetR77: JohnLegere TMobile didn't know he was CEO of tmobile, I have T-Mobile, it's pathetic, dropped calls, no service." 
Tom Brady just did it again. He is not only a great guy, he is, without question, the BEST quarterback! 
President Obama just told President Putin how important the Russian air strikes against ISIS have been. I TOLD YOU SO! 
JohnLegere TMobile John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers.

Glad to see that RondaRousey lost her championship fight last night. Was soundly beaten - not a nice person! 
I have watched sloppy Graydon Carter fail and close Spy Magazine and now am watching him fail at VanityFair Magazine. He is a total loser! 
VanityFair Magazine is doing really poorly. It has gotten worse and worse over the years, and has lost almost all of it's former allure!

Wow, Bernie Sanders just admitted that the real unemployment rate is 10 (it is actually over 20) and for African American youth - 51. 
Hillary and Sanders are not doing well, but what is the failed former Mayor of Baltimore doing on that stage? O'Malley is a clown. 
Why won't President Obama use the term Islamic Terrorism? Isn't it now, after all of this time and so much death, about time!

We need much tougher, much smarter leadership - and we need it NOW! 
President Obama said "ISIL continues to shrink" in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad! CHANGE. 
My prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible Paris attacks. May God be with you all. 
Boy is this guy ShepNewsTeam tough on me. So totally biased. As a reporter, he should be ashamed of himself!  
They laughed at me when I said to bomb the ISIS controlled oil fields. Now they are not laughing and doing what I said.  
Thank you JakeTapper for giving me credit for my vision on bombing the oil fields. Should have been done long ago.  
Great honor to be inducted into the NJ Boxing Hall of Fame last night. Thank you! Timing could not have been better! 
seanhannity Carly, whose campaign is dead, is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope! Sad. 
CarlyFiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning Ben Carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign! 
CarlyFiorina I only said I was on 60Minutes four weeks ago with Putinnever said I was in Green Room. Separate piecesgreat ratings! 
CarlyFiorina Ben Carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper amp; pathological disease. I didnt say it, he did. Apology? 
CarlyFiorina CarlyI did graduate from Wharton and did very well. Who is your fact checker? Will you apologize? 
CarlyFiorina Carly, not just you, I also told Gov. Kasich to let Jeb talk, give him a chance because Kasich was constantly cutting in. 
DRUDGE_REPORT: REUTERS 5-DAY ROLLING POLL: TRUMP 34, CARSON 19.6, RUBIO 9.7, CRUZ 7.7..." Thank you - a great honor!

I will be on with BretBaier tonight at 6PM.  
Macys was very disloyal to me bc of my strong stance on illegal immigration. Their stock has crashed!  
Thank you Forbes for showing the WSJ was wrong. So dishonest! 
From 2 to 27 in Texas - quite a jump into first place! 
Wow, pres. candidate Ben Carson, who is very weak on illegal Immigration, just said he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship. 
Total fool KarlRove is part of the Republican Establishment problem. An all talk, no action dummy! 
WSJ and dopey Karl Rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible TPP deal. 
Why does the failing WSJ write a false editorial about me and let dummy KarlRove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper? 
KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP. This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100 
We, as a country, either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY! 
Why wouldn't the WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly! 
When and how are the dummies at the WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want "smart" trade deals. 
The WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate. 
WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize. China not part but will get their way in later. 
Today's WSJ Editorial is WRONG again. I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door. 
I will be interviewed on MariaBartiromo FoxBusiness at 7:30 
All seven on-line polls, including Drudge and Time, with thousands of respondents, said I won the debate. krauthammer said I was "so, so." 
ellenEspence: I'm not convinced that any candidate other than realDonaldTrump is committed to securing our borders.

Carson now admits his friend named "Bob," who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!), no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name! 
With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it? 
Such bad reporting: A puff piece on Ben Carson in the nytimes states that Carson "is trying to solidify his lead." But I am  easily! Sad

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered! 
Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a "lightweight". 
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor! 
Jeb's new slogan - "Jeb can fix it". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word "fix" is not a good one to use in politics! 
Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio READ THIS: 
Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.Rubs can't win

I spell out some of the differences between Ben Carson and myself at 9:00 A.M. on CNN jaketapper. Ben is very weak on illegal immigration. 
A big POLL will be announced this morning on CBSNews Face The Nation. I wonder if I do well if the press will report the results? Doubt it

HankCampbell: Democrats seem to be more interested in Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton. 
BeverlySimcic: TRUMP: JEB BUSH HAS NO MONEY, HE'S MEETING WITH MOMMY AND DADDY- CAN'T RUN HIS OWN CAMPAIGN 
JebBush is slashing campaign salaries, people making millions. If he can't manage his campaign, how can he manage our countries finances? 
JebBush had a tiny 300 person crowd at Senator Tim Scott's forum. I had thousands, and they had real passion! 
JebBush is totally lost -- he spends too much time managing the bloated staff of his campaign amp; not enough talking about America's future. 
Expecting a great crowd of amazing people. Questions will be live!  
I will be doing the TodayShow live from New Hampshire at 7am on Monday morning.

Does everyone remember MittRomney and his famous remarks about "self-deportation" and "47". He was done. I don't need his angry advice! 
MittRomney and his campaign manager should not be critical of candidates after they blew an election that should never have been lost! 
MittRomney can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because I have been openly hard on his terrible "choke" loss to Obama! 
blondesforjesus: FoxNewsSunday Loving realDonaldTrump interview.   Thank you. 
FoxNewsSunday 
Jeb, why did your brother attack and destabalize the Middle East by attacking Iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction? Bad info? 
This morning Chris Wallace has the best political show on television - but that's only because I'm on it (kidding)! Have fun. 
Jeb Bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them. Also, Rubio is hitting him hard! 
On at 9:00A.M. or 10:00 A.M. (depending on your location) on Fox is a tough but really good interview with Chris Wallace. Enjoy!

TRUMPHIANT2016: I've never seen a candidate as dominant in early states as realDonaldTrump   
JebBush, At the debate you said your brother kept us safe- I wanted to be nice amp; did not mention the WTC came down during his watch, 9/11.

EricTrump was FANTASTIC on foxandfriends this morning. He may be my son but he is a special guy! 
CNBC has just agreed that the debate will be TWO HOURS. Fantastic news for all, especially the millions of people who will be watching! 
lance_combrink: realDonaldTrump Karl Rove still thinks Romney won. Why is he still on TV?" 
Hohummm: Did you also hear Megyn say "Carson is the front-runner ...according so some polls ..tied in other polls" OUTRIGHT LIE!" Hatred! 
RickStans1: Donald, Megyn Kelly seeks ratings, not truth Not much of a journalist. Stay focused amp; make your own narrative. It's working" 
Every poll, Time, Drudge, Slate and others, said I won both debates - but heard Megyn Kelly had her two puppets say bad stuff. I don't watch 
marcthiessen is a failed Bush speechwriter whose work was so bad that he has never been able to make a comeback. A third rate talent! 
ofccadjust: Such a played out segment as well, can't stand to watch her anymore. The bobbing head drives me nuts...  
Megyn Kelly has two really dumb puppets, Chris Stirewalt amp; Marc Threaten (a Bushy) who do exactly what she says. All polls say I won debates

Why is the GOP being asked to do a debate that is so much longer than the just-aired and very boring  
CNBC is pushing the GOP around by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials. 
The GOP should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that CNBC is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party.
