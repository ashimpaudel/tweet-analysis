The person Brazil's elites want to install as President - Michel Temer - is not only implicated in corruption. Majority wants him impeached!
"Brazil: whether it's a ""coup"" is semantics. It's a pure attack on democracy: they want to ensure population has no say in choosing President"

"@ryanlcooper Lke if GOP waited for Obama to get very unpopular, then used their majorities in Congress to impeach him &amp; Biden, install Ryan"
@ryanlcooper They want to avoid that because it's bad PR. But I think democracy is their last choice because they can never win that way.
VP Michel Temer hates the idea of new elections because he could never be elected President: his only chance is being installed w/o a vote.
"To summarize the person Brazil's elites are trying to install as President: elections are a ""coup""; installing him w/o one is democratic."

@ThomasEWoods @JustinRaimondo That's a false assumption. I've pointed out many times where Rubio &amp; Cruz are more extreme warmongers.

@billmon1 @Johngcole @freddiedeboer @JonathanCohn Please stop it. I genuinely can't take that column &amp; am trying hard to forget it exists.
@KitTraverse @Johngcole @billmon1 @JonathanCohn She's seeking massive power. Of course we're going to scrutinize &amp; critique her
@Johngcole @billmon1 @freddiedeboer @JonathanCohn That one is special.
"@Johngcole @billmon1 @freddiedeboer @JonathanCohn Yeah - in fairness, he talks about that."
@billmon1 @freddiedeboer @JonathanCohn The real question now to be investigated: does Bernie surprise with cakes or make calls upon a death?
@billmon1 @freddiedeboer @JonathanCohn He's an Obama veteran &amp; speechwriter so knows this is pure reality TV show https://t.co/IAFQ8zbTgz
@W_Runnymede Those of us who actually work to defend free speech understand difference b/w agreeing w/a view &amp; supporting its suppression
"@W_Runnymede Yes, it is. You tried to depict me as a supporter of speech suppression but can only do that by outright lying."
He was fired for lying and fabricating Marco Rubio's words - then immediately hired by MSNBC.  https://t.co/mBsjworLyg
So did the prior one  https://t.co/8VFb374BdI https://t.co/Ezm2SFLfdt
"@W_Runnymede You're lying. Also: any time you want to compare the work we've done defending free speech, let me know."
"I wasn't really a big fan of this tweet when it was first posted, but it's really grown on me.... https://t.co/8aeolpgV8B"
@itsBIB It should be disclosed to the viewers when they're getting payments from the people on whom they're commenting. This is basic.
Yep. That illustrates how Christie &amp; Trump (&amp; Giuliani) have similar authoritarian streaks... https://t.co/D7cYvcZLlo
@AngelaMilanese That's awesome. Combining stray dogs and tennis is basically my conception of heaven.
@itsBIB Are you illiterate? The article has nothing at all to do with journalists having opinions.
"@itsBIB No, idiot: I don't claim to be objective and free of bias. Exactly the opposite."
This was Chris Christie's best moment of his career - couldn't be more at odds with Trump's demagoguery on Muslims https://t.co/j1LzTpm1Cp

@chrislhayes Sorry - deleted due to Trump-like typo! Then re-posted.
Giuliani is very much the same - makes a perfect addition to that little group https://t.co/1ckGu3bHDm https://t.co/EzVrRkzJSi

@WaqarVick I only saw some vague references to it on Twitter. Is there a transcript or video?
"And then he invaded Panama, killing thousands, to show how un-wimpy he was https://t.co/hcURR1S1Dc https://t.co/kj1afAhLN5"
Please. His campaign manager was Lee Atwater and he won with Willie Horton ads.  https://t.co/kj1afAhLN5
"@FrankConniff Actually, I sent you the wrong link - I meant this article https://t.co/F7gxo8wvLa"
@FrankConniff Thanks. I appreciate that. I highly recommend this article if you haven't already read it: https://t.co/QBy4TgFcTG
"@wc521usa Yeah, that's totally comparable. Really brilliant point."
It's one thing to support Clinton. NYT Ed Page still does. It's another to say: I think she should keep her $250K speeches to Wall St secret
@ethaniacobozzi I totally agree. It's to their credit.
@thejdubble So you think Ted Cruz should set the ethical standards by which Clinton should conduct herself? You don't want to know?
"""Voters have every right to know what Clinton told these groups"" - NYT Editorial Page: does *anyone* contest this? https://t.co/QBy4TgFcTG"
"NYT Editorial Page  - which endorsed Clinton - on Clinton, today  https://t.co/QBy4TgFcTG https://t.co/hxcXMBbsl9"
@BillBaggins96 They said they would support Clinton over Trump. Could that be clearer? Blair said he supports her against everyone.
Always worth listening to. And reading his novels .... https://t.co/vhcVEfmk5f
@David747Heavy He said he'd vote Clinton over Trump
@busbyj2 I've repeatedly said there is no circumstance under which I'd support Trump. Your reasoning skills need work.
"So far she has Max Boot, Robert Kagan and Tony Blair, with praise from Kissinger. When will Bill Kristol endorse? https://t.co/5IpBkUYGQQ"
I'll probably be pointing out every day yet another neocon declaring support for Clinton over Trump https://t.co/6MDTjg0Ywj
@FrankConniff How can you publicly claim I said racism wasn't a huge part of Trump's appeal when I explicitly said the exact opposite?
"@Atrios @Will_Bunch It was somewhat bipartisan, but not completely https://t.co/8b7aayCjjz - https://t.co/PuXIT6xAjV"
@Atrios @Will_Bunch Which is really weird since it was all done out of the deepest concern for The Libyan People.
@Will_Bunch She hasn't had to defend it hardly at all. I really wonder how she will. It's caused massive instability in multiple regions.
