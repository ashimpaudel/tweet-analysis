Clinton winning Connecticut Dems by 18 points; Sanders in the hunt bc of 54-point margin with crossover independents.

"Why does Tweetdeck insist on correcting Kasich to “Katich,” which is not a word."
@varadmehta @ForecasterEnten Also makes Katich’s point about staying in. Those suburbs ain’t going for Cruz.

Some of Trump's big Hill detractors are 2010 Tea Party members who think he's a self-promoter with no strategy. (Some are not!)
"Cruz: ""Among the career politicians in Washington I am not the most popular person."" WI's own Ron Johnson, not a career pol, dislikes him."
In 90 seconds Cruz has turned the Q about why senators don't like him over to his riff on Trump donating to Democrats.
"Sykes asks Cruz why Senate colleagues aren't endorsing him:

""People across the country are frustrated,"" says Cruz, pivoting immediately."
Next level yglz tweet right here https://t.co/j91umHgWkg
This @SykesCharlie interview with Cruz is admirably tough. Lots of yes-but-how follow-up.
"Cruz demurs on Q about Romney's Trump critique: ""What I agree with is that the policies Donald is supporting will not fix the problems."""
"Cruz insists he will keep Trump attacks to policy: ""I have zero interest whatsoever in any parts of Donald Trump’s anatomy."" #nsfw"
"Cruz on why he had a detente with Trump: ""If you look at a number of the candidates who took on Donald early on, they ended up as roadkill."""
"Sykes asks Cruz about the Trump Heidi tweet, then reminds him of his tweet saying he wouldn't get in a ""cage match"" with Trump."
"@TheFix You on point, Fix?"
So far Cruz has turned every Q at this forum into a pointed attack on a Trump policy.
"Cruz, pushed on whether he wants to carpet-bomb or precision-bomb ISIS: ""I mean using overwhelming airpower to saturation-bomb them."""
"Cruz is building escape hatches left and right on this ""patrolling Muslim neighborhoods"" Q: ""My focus is on stopping Islamists."""

"Kasich on Wisconsin: ""We're gonna do fine here. I'm not gonna predict we're gonna win here."""
Kasich asks for Wisconsin’s help “in the next 10 days or whatever it is.” (It’s 13 days)
Kasich dodges Q about Trump/Cruz by saying RNC delegates will decide that only he can beat Hillary.
"VOTER: “If you don’t get this nomination, will you support this bozo Trump or this Cruz?”

KASICH: “Boy, I wish I hadn’t called on you."""
"Kasich says he's got less press bc he's polite: “Just ask your governor, who labored in obscurity because he wouldn’t call anybody names."""
https://t.co/sBlYkT7Gej
@EsotericCD I also think it makes a big dif if Kasich enters Cleveland with just Ohio or if he has won a couple April 26 states.
"April 19 increasingly looks like a defining day of the primary; if Trump romps, Cruz joins Kasich in the “no path to 1237” club,"
"Kasich says Trump clearly beats Cruz without him in the race: ""I'm the only one who can compete in the east."""

"Sen. Ben Sasse, who has taken the fight to Trump harder than anyone, does not mention his name in CPAC speech."
"INTERNET: I demand a photoshop of Christie at the Trump presser, only wearing the Mad Max: Fury road hood ornament mask."
That's the show that takes place in a boring alternate reality where Donald Trump isn't the GOP frontrunner https://t.co/423uySnJ0R

"This CPAC is totally different. In the past, activists put up a resistance, in vain, to McCain and Romney. Now it's Trump."

"Unless this list is wrong, neither Trump nor Cruz has won a single newspaper endorsement. https://t.co/MBf34mhGt9"
"One caveat about using CPAC to see what GOP voters think of Trump: In 2015 straw poll, Trump got 3.5% support. Rand Paul won with 25.7%."

This is a good point. OK and AK polls overestimated Trump vote. https://t.co/xwzew9F8y5
"We get our first real test of how Cruz plays in the rust belt megastates next week, with Michigan. So far he is barely competing."
"By my math, Cruz has won 180 of the 662 delegates available in Southern states so far. Recall that his master plan was to dominate there."
