About 150 million of the people who do use health services are subjected to financial catastrophe annually  
People-centred and integrated health services are critical for reaching universal health coverage   
At least a billion people suffer each year because they cannot obtain the health services they need   
If ppl have to pay most of the health care cost out of their own pockets, the poor will be unable to obtain many of the services they need 
Universal health coverage means that all ppl receive the health services they need without suffering financial hardship when paying for them 
Q: How to get, be and stay healthy without suffering financial hardship? A: Universal health coverage  
The Americas became the first region to eliminate rubella and congenital rubella syndrome, a major achievement  
 was validated as having eliminated maternal amp; neonatal tetanus because it committed to improving access to immunization  
Checking vaccination cards at every visit is an easy way of improving global  coverage  
Health workers should always check  cards when children are seen for well-child care or sick visits 
Many children do not come back for their second amp; third doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine 
Commentary: Isolated gains in  need to become the norm  
Vulnerable and marginalized groups in societies are often less likely to enjoy the right to health 
Universal health coverage is a means to promote the right to health 
The right to health includes access to timely, acceptable, and affordable health care of appropriate quality

Topical anaesthetics can relieve pain during vaccination, but WHO does not recommend them due to the high cost, lack of availability 
Distractions such as toys, videos and music are recommended for children under six years of age when vaccinated 
Infants should be breastfed during or shortly before the vaccination session, if it is culturally acceptable 
When multiple vaccines are scheduled to be injected in the same session, they shld be given in order of painfulness w/ the most painful last 
Do not pull back the plunger of a syringe prior to intramuscular injections as this may increase pain 
People to be vaccinated should be positioned properly - infants amp; young children should be held by their caregiver

In countries as different as   amp;  tobacco taxes have helped cut tobacco use, provided funds for health care 
The UN ought to encourage countries to raise tobacco taxes to support t/ sustainable dev goals amp; reduce tobacco use 
Around the world, 10 people die every minute from a tobacco-related disease. Say  
If the primary role of govt is to protect lives and we believe it is then tobacco taxes are an essential tool 
The most price-sensitive demographic for tobacco use is young people, who tend to have less disposable income 
Increasing taxes on cigarettes amp; other tobacco products has mostly been a strategy for reducing usage  it has proven incredibly successful 
Why, after all, should governments effectively subsidize tobacco companies by picking up the tab for the health care costs they generate? 
The tobacco industry, which generates more than USD35 billion in annual profits, ought to bear the costs it inflicts upon society: tax 
In the U.S. alone, smoking related illnesses result in USD170 billion in medical care spending each year  
By 2030, its expected that 8m people a year will die from tobacco use  80 of those deaths will occur in developing countries

Todas las personas mayores son distintas, y algunas tienen capacidades fsicas y mentales de una persona de 30 aos. 
Older people are often incorrectly assumed to be frail or dependent, and a burden to society  
There's no typical older person. Some 80 year-olds have physical amp; mental capacities of 30 year-olds  
There is little evidence to suggest that older ppl today are experiencing their later years in better health than their parents  
Older people also contribute in many ways to their families and communities  
A longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole  
Today, for the first time in history, most people worldwide can expect to live into their 60s amp; beyond  
RobinCritchley Hi Robin, sorry to see you go. Today is the Intl Day of Older Persons amp; we had a Twitter chat, hence the many tweets 
CaringAcrossGen Thank you for your question!

Age_Int Thanks for following the  Twitter chat on ageing amp; health!  
MacHealthForum Thank you for following the  Twitter chat!  
JJackONeill We haven't used it often, and hopefully we won't. But  is indeed a helpful feature 
That's a wrap for our  Twitter chat on  amp; health! Thanks to those who asked Qs! Here's the recap 
Agreed!   
Support healthy ageing in all policies and at all levels of governments   
Countries shld fund those services that enable older people to do what is important to them   
Fortaleciendo los msculos (ejercicios especficos p/ cada msculo), reduciendo peso (si la persona tiene sobrepeso) 
Doctors shld do comprehensive assessments of older patients capacity. This will reduce need for acute care  
Ageism is now more common than sexism amp; racism. We must combat ageism amp; age-related discrimination  
Not necessarily - functional capacity is a much better indicator of health than any specific disease  
There is a lot we can do to prevent diseases across the life course, e.g. healthy behaviours. Start now!  
Continuous training for health workers on  and older people is essential.   
Example in South Africa (pg. 216)   
Older ppl associations can be supported to improve access to health amp; social care

An essential part of long-term care for older people   
It is indeed a problem. Social services are needed, families need to be supported   
V important. Need to increase understanding of older population's health amp; what works to improve   
We need to increase awareness on the need for palliative care amp; address misconceptions about t/ nature of it  
Invest in health amp; functioning of older workers, support gradual retirement/flexible work   
Healthy ageing possible for everybody. Info needs to be targeted for different audiences, e.g. policy makers  
Tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diets all increase the risk of noncommunicable diseases  
By providing self-help, skills training and support at the right time   
Ageing population will increase burden of chronic diseases. But this is preventable   
By investing in health and long-term care   
We need to create  environment, e.g. accessible housing, transportation   
Countries need to improve access to social protection to poor older people

Today is International Day of Older Persons. The number of ppl over 60 yrs is expected to double by 2050  
Dr Chan: Having good data on normal disease patterns at the community level aids recognition of an unusual disease event  
Dr Chan: Some analysts argue that universal health coverage is the best defence against the infectious disease threat, nationally amp; globally 
Dr Chan: If the economy is doing well, where is the incentive to invest in equitable health care?  
Dr Chan: Today, 70 of the worlds poor live in middle-income countries. This is a game-changing statistic  
Dr Chan: Some multinational corporations can be another transboundary threat   
Dr Chan: Ministers of health look at the medical and scientific evidence. But ministers of trade and finance often listen to other voices

Here is the latest WHO  situation report (30 September 2015)  
Dr Chan: Antimicrobial resistance is now regarded as a major health and medical crisis   
Dr Chan: Every new  drug approved in 2014 by the US_FDA cost more than USD120,000 per patient per year  
Dr Chan: The world is ill-prepared to cope. Few health systems were built to manage chronic if not life-long conditions  
CodyTucholke Thanks for following the conversation on  - important topic that concerns us all  
Dr Chan: Chronic noncommunicable diseases have overtaken infectious diseases as the worlds biggest killers   
Dr Chan:  reached a tipping point when the number of ppl newly receiving antiretroviral therapy surpassed the number of new infections 
Dr Chan: Maternal and child mortality fell at the fastest rate in history, with some of the sharpest drops recorded in sub-Saharan Africa 
Dr Chan: The 21st century began well for public health  
The following tweets are from Dr Chan's lecture at the Georgetown University, Washington, DC, US on Global Health's 21st century Challenge 
Dr Chan: It's in our hands to help older persons to live a dignified life  
Dr Chan: For older people, the top priority is the maintenance of functional ability  
Dr Chan: Though most older people will eventually experience multiple health problems, older age does not imply dependence  
Dr Chan: The [World Report on Ageing amp; Health] counters these misperceptions w/ the facts... There is no typical older person  
Dr Chan: Some barriers to maintaining the health amp; independence of older people come from common perceptions based on outdated stereotypes 
Dr Chan: One statistic underscores the burden of unsupported family care. Around 10 of older people are victims of elder abuse  
Dr Chan: Older people often fill hospital beds, not because they need acute care, but because there is nowhere else to go  
Dr Chan: In many countries, [providing] long-term care [for older people] stops someone from going to school or work  
Dr Chan: As populations age, and the proportion of older people grows, such arrangements become unsustainable  
Kounila jjmahat820 Hi - you can download our new report on  and Health from here  
Dr Chan: Long-term care is frequently left to families with little guidance or support either from govts or intl organizations  
Dr Chan: Most health systems were set up to manage acute conditions. The biggest challenges for older people come from chronic diseases 
Dr Chan: The world report on  and health brings together the latest evidence on the health of older people  
Dr Chan: One global trend is certain: populations are ageing, and at a very fast pace  
The following tweets are from Dr Chan's remarks at the launch of the World Report on  and Health in Washington DC, US  
Govts need to dvlp long-term care syst. that can reduce inappropriate use of acute health serv., ensure ppl live their last yrs w/ dignity 
We need to realign health systems to the needs of older people  
Let's make the places we live in much more friendly to older people  
The Report stresses that govts must ensure policies that enable older people to continue participating in society  
There is little evidence to suggest that older ppl today are experiencing their later years in better health than their parents  
Unfortunately 70 does not yet appear to be the new 60. But it could be. And it should be  
Dr Chan: Today, most ppl, even in the poorest countries, are living longer lives. We need to ensure these extra yrs are healthy, meaningful 
With advances in medicine helping more people to live longer lives, the number of ppl over 60 is expected to double by 2050

ChaitanyaJosen Malnutrition does not refer only to undernutrition, but both undernutrition and overweight 
Wasting is caused by sudden or acute  due either to insufficient caloric intake or disease amp; poses an immediate risk of death 
ChaitanyaJosen Wasted here refers to when children are too thin for their height 
Wasting = when children are too thin for their height  
Southern Asia is home to more than half of all the wasted children under 5  
Wasting still threatens the lives of 50 million children under five years across the globe 
Canal2Poulin Thank you, Franoise! Glad that you appreciate our linked tweeting :) 
The greatest increases in overweight children hv been in lower-middle-income countries, more than doubling since 1990 
kateomega Cc-ing our colleagues in WHOAFRO so they can follow-up directly, since your media query is Africa-specific 
Noncommunicable diseases are e.g. cardiovascular diseases (like heart attacks and stroke), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes 
Overweight children take in more calories than they expend. These children are at increased risk of noncommunicable diseases later in life 
Overweight = when a child is too heavy for their height 
Despite what many people assume, in 2014 nearly three-quarters of all overweight children lived in Asia and Africa 
There are 41m overweight children aged under five in the world - about 10m more than in 1990 
kateomega Hi Kate, thanks for your tweet. We have passed on your message to the media team. 
Stunting = when a child is too short for their age, due to a failure to grow both physically and cognitively 
While stunting has fallen by 52 in Asia and 57 in Latin America, it has increased by 23 in Africa since 1990 
The number of children who are stunted is falling worldwide but 159m are still affected

New guidance for care of pregnant women during an  outbreak 
There is NO evidence to show that women who survive  and subsequently become pregnant pose a risk for Ebola virus transmission 
WHO published new guidance for care of pregnant women during an  outbreak 
Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest under-five mortality rate in the world w/ 1 child in 12 dying before his or her fifth birthday 
A childs chance of survival is still vastly different based on where he or she is born 
Quality care around the time of childbirth incl ensuring early skin-to-skin contact, exclusive breastfeeding can save thousands of lives 
Most child deaths are easily preventable by proven and readily available interventions  
Prematurity, pneumonia, complications during labour amp; delivery, diarrhoea, sepsis, malaria are leading causes of children deaths lt;5 yrs old 
Too large number of children still dying from preventable causes before their fifth birthday  and indeed within their first month of life 
Nevertheless, 16,000 children under five still die every day. We cannot continue to fail them  
Under-five deaths have dropped from 12.7m per year in 1990 to 5.9m in 2015. This is the first year the figure has gone below 6m mark!

Dr Chan: At present, WHO does not have a mechanism for enforcing compliance with its recommended measures. This has to change 
Dr Chan on travel restrictions during  If countries are punished in this way, where is the incentive for rapid,transparent reporting? 
Dr Chan: 8 yrs after IHR entered into force, fewer than a third of WHO Member States meet the min reqs for core capacities to implement [it] 
Dr Chan: Compliance w/ the obligation to build core capacities for event detection amp; response [under Intl Health Regs] has been dismal 
Dr Chan:  in West Africa was the largest, longest, and most deadly event in the nearly four-decade history of this disease 
Dr Chan: Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases have become a much larger menace under the unique conditions of the 21st century 
Dr Chan: [Intl Health Regulations] are the only internationally-agreed set of rules governing ... response to outbreaks 
Dr Chan: We need to pinpoint the reasons why the [ response fell short. We need to learn the lessons
