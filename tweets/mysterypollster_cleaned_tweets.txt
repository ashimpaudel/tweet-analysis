This weeks BC/SurveyMonkey tracker has Clinton leading Trump among women by 21 pts (50 to 29). Just sayin 
Trump hits 50 for first time in NBC ews/SurveyMonkey tracking 
Based on SurveyMonkey election tracking survey 
A nice review of the workings of exit polls and election night projections from Edison's JoeLenski 
A majority of Democrats (58) want Clinton to pick Sanders as VPand more VEEP polling from SurveyMonkey 
Re-upping for journo friends: A fantastic CA-based senior editor/editorial director job at SurveyMonkey 
How do the presidential candidates stack up against Game of Thrones characters? SurveyMonkey goes there 
vavreck :-) 
So help out a DC homeboy and  Danoff (and please RT!) 2/2 
Primary-shrimary. It's not every day you watch the kid who grew up across the street compete for the last slot on The Voice, so.... 1/2 
This week, among Reps nationwide, NBC/SurveyMonkey finds Trump 46, Cruz 28, Kasich 19; mostly stable for last month 
This week's *national* NBC/SurveyMonkey results (not a NY only poll) 
Huge congrats to jasoncherkis, though if you ask me, he deserved the big prize 
joshbzin For case against, see Rogers amp; Aida 
joshbzin Intent is crudely predictive (see link), but actual vote history, when available, is much better 
Put another way: We experimented with the vote intent question to gauge the effect of Trump or  
As with vote preference, supporters of Trump, Cruz amp; Kasich hedge on their general election turnout intent 
randomsubu a third party candidate is yuge-ly hypothetical, Ill grant, and the likely explanation for the different D-R margins 
icymi 
The latest NBCNews/@SurveyMonkey results: Trump amp; Clinton hold their primary leads, many voters open to 3rd party 
Clinton may lose younger voters to Sanders, but they give her huge margins against Trump 
bjmartino Oh wow...you're taking me way back with that 
nataliemjb Yep 
Trump down 3 to 45 in latest NBC ews/SurveyMonkey national poll, Cruz 28, Kasich 18

Budget What part of "honor the commitment your agent made that I could cancel...by phone, within 24 hours" didn't you understand? 
TheRickWilson No argument there 
Budget if I didnt need it, which I dont. Now, I call, they tell me it cant be done. Fraud.

Thanks nataliemjb! Never too late 
davidimiller BobFishell so most people answered the phone when it rang, and were less apt to hang up abruptly on a stranger 
davidimiller BobFishell Exactly. In the 80s, everyone had a landline phone at home, few/none had caller ID, telemarketers rarely called 
davidimiller BobFishell Uptick? Telemarketing as you know it barely existed in 1985. And people would actually answer a ringing phone. 
ForecasterEnten I was 9 months old and in Cleveland. Coincidence? 
ForecasterEnten Im going with conspiracy. Definitely conspiracy. 
Honored to talk to chrisriback amp; politicalwire about polling and what were up to at SurveyMonkey in 2016 
bjmartino Does analytics have a world championship? 
nataliemjb And MN, KS amp; IA were caucuses- single digit turnout of adults in first two 
Clinton lead over Sanders expands to +17 nationwide in NBC/ SurveyMonkey tracking 
ElectProject Probably semantic, but Ohio election officials still refer to it as a "change" in "affiliation" 
aedwardslevy autocorrect? 
Great question, aedwardslevy 
skoczela File this under: "Tweets likely to stimulate a recurring nightmare." 
bjmartino "Politics, man" 
Yes, that. Also, lot of "I want to be on tee-vee" ias!aedwardslevy Social desirability bias! 
Or 5 minutes after 
Trump up to 40 against all GOP candidates; Clinton maintains 10-point lead 
Trump leads Rubio 52-46 in one-on-one tested by BC/SurveyMonkey 
SurveyMonkey data shows Clinton up big in GA, TN amp; VA; narrow edge in MA 
SurveyMonkey data shows Trump leading in AL, AR, GA, OK, TN amp; VA; Cruz with edge in TX 
Also: Weve published estimates for the GOP race in 7 states and the Dems in 4 
GOP Super Tuesday race looks unchanged by last weeks debate, per 7K+ SurveyMonkey interviews 
NateSilver538 ForecasterEnten True. Polls in the 08 primary also consistently understated Obamas margins with African-Americans. 
NateSilver538 ForecasterEnten Poll error would be similar to error in 2008, no? 
Clinton won Hispanics 61-35 in 2008, per the ABC exit poll compilation 
Last sentence: Yep 
ForecasterEnten A drunken washout? cc bjmartino 
Internet: I need a gif of Rubio rolling his eyes at Trump! 
adamhgeller :-) 
Sounds like a scene coming soon to my recurring nightmare 
aedwardslevy Younger voters in 2020 will ask, "what's that?" 
Now *that* would be a banner point 
Rubio's pollster Whit Ayres 
Cc frankrichny 
This is just for fun, not part of our election tracking. Check it out! 
For your "be careful what you wish for" file 
GOP race remains largely unchanged in NBC/SurveyMonkey national tracking: Trump 36, Cruz 19, Rubio 16, Kasich 8 
SimonWDC No 
Clinton holds big lead among African Americans but Sanders narrows gap among Hispanic Dems 
YeaYouRite williamjordann With respect, Ive not weighed in on NV. More about the trend in our own data say at the national level 
More on what the NBC/SurveyMonkey tracking says about the second choices of Bush supporters 
YeaYouRite ForecasterEnten Nate_Cohn politicswthsoul So 56-39 Clinton lead is based on n=131? 
Nate_Cohn YeaYouRite politicswthsoul Also, I missed in edit process that we left out Dem/Hispanic sample size, roughly n=400 per week 
Nate_Cohn YeaYouRite politicswthsoul Did they publish field dates more specific than "February?" If they did, I missed. 
michaelcohen SurveyMonkey UCWashington Was fun. Thanks for inviting me! 
aedwardslevy Looking forward to reading yours Monday morning 
Nate_Cohn JoeLenski 3/ Also, davidshor, *you* can tell us what rough  of NV Dem Hispanics live in those majority Hispanic precincts, no? 
I approve this message 
davidshor Nate_Cohn 2/ JoeLenski can probably tell us what  of the sample comes from those majority Latino precints 
davidshor Nate_Cohn 1/ Entrance poll Hispanic estimate based on 200 interviews (weighted at least), so theres that, and.. 
POLITICO_Steve Exit poll Yoda, you are? 
amyewalter Yep. The narrative that always makes me cringe: Based on 2 of the precincts counted. 
Media: *This* is the way to report *early* election returns 
JoeLenski gmp2020 skoczela MargieOmero  to DemFromCT. Respect 
JoeLenski DemFromCT gmp2020 skoczela MargieOmero  
DemFromCT gmp2020 JoeLenski skoczela MargieOmero Im willing to predict with 100 confidence that hes pretty busy right now 
Love these too! 
YeaYouRite Granted, still just 1/4 counted, but history should tell you trust actual count over early entrance poll estimate 
Exit poll estimate now showing Clinton +3 in Clark 
Ok*this* is data I trust 
Hes right. Results so far imply close race in NV, not much beyond thatyet. 
There's that... 
ForecasterEnten RalstonReports I see no problem there. Plus, he's Univ. of Michigan alum, so... 
This is a cool idea...hope it works 
Among Latino Voters nationwide: Clinton Lead narrows significantly since Iowa SurveyMonkey with jcpolls 
jarrodmyrick Charming. You really believe that? 
Another good question. As a semi-alum of JPSM (UM/UMd), I have to recommend it... 
andrewjwheeler I'm curious what media pollsters would say, but...prob find a way to work or intern for one 
Love this question. Fellow pollsters, what say you? cc andrewjwheeler 
andrewjwheeler If campaign, I'd try to work on one, in any capacity, in addition to academic background in surveys, stats and coding (R!) 
andrewjwheeler Great Q!. What kind of pollster do you hope to be (media, campaign)? Fwiw, my path was polisci major w/ stats "cognate" 
jbview Ignore those poll yuks! 
Nice summary of why polling the NV caucuses is hard 
Note this well. NV's turnout is lower than IA, *very* hard to get probable electorate right

Pretty great story, and a good reminder of how NH can surprise 
Wow..well, thanks and best of luck! 
If this outlier is the story beyond Morning Joe, strategic voting could make it a self-fulfilling prophecy 
randomsubu Afraid not 
More skoczela: "plenty of anecdotal evidence" to hint at "last minute shift, but not enough time to confirm it." 
Terrific NH summation by MassINC pollster skoczela: "Things Still Change After Polls End" 
Very similar to 2008 NH Dems, if I remember right

MarianneValen20 JohnJHarwood kwcollins You hate candidate A, like B, C amp; D, decide based on which of B, C, D has best chance to beat A 
Can't say this often enough 
Remember, turnout for NV will be significantly *lower* than IA. Have yet to see any poll close to true electorate

Shocker 
ThePollsters jcpolls In other words, many evangelicals may have decided late to actually attend a caucus

DFerrisi Selzer last week: 45 could still be persuaded to support another candidate 
Point of my last tweet: Conditions seem ripe for a lot of strategic voting, i.e. shifting to Rubio over final weekend. Second place? 
Final IA snapshot has Trump ahead, Cruz falling, Rubio rising, leading on 2nd choice amp; 27 for someone else. Hmm. 
Agree with danpfeiffer. Remember, it gets *very* prominent coverage in an environment primed for strategic voting 
Or until some actual votes are counted? 
sethmeyers shows why Iowa phone polling is hard (and funny!) via nataliemjb 
Yes, I'm biased, but if you're a polling junkie you should be reading the HuffPollster newsletter every morning 
a 68 percent majority of the [GOP] activists surveyed now say that Trump is capable of winning a general election 
Very happy to see aedwardslevy and nataliemjb fielded a 3rd GOP activist survey and amazed at the results

AmericanAir You can start by sending a DM 
Wow AmericanAir. Just wow. 
aedwardslevy Truly wonderful, the mind of a voter is. 
aedwardslevy Yes, but only when The Force is strong among the interviewers. "This is not the answer category you're looking for..."

Cruz has room to grow in chart w/Carson still at 14, and 35 of Carson vote picking Cruz as 2nd choice (per DMR) 
4for4_John 4for4_Josh Guys: I believe the 2nd to last sentence here needs an edit Monitor Ingram practice? 
GerryDales kwcollins and late shifts, strategic voting etc 
GerryDales kwcollins Yep, but... also another kind of error (measurement) on low digit candidates, per JoeLenski 
Polling errors do tend to be bigger when turnout is lower (and when  of competitive candidates gt; 2) kwcollins 
wccubbison How many? How long have they been there? And most importantly, what are they doing? 
EdAsante77 monkeycageblog yes, but see my follow up. Ran a massive effort to ID supporters and turn them out. Not just speeches. 
Important re last tweet: Watch is whether Trump is doing anything on the ground in IA to ID his supporters and help them find caucus sites 
A very important finding - critical to reading other polls - though we wont know if its predictive until Feb 1 
quentinfountain Thanks. Sorry I missed via email, but great to hear from you!

Dont miss the replay of this  amazing  
KSoltisAnderson monkeycageblog See our write-up by nataliemjb amp; aedwardslevy  makes that point 
KSoltisAnderson monkeycageblog Something simpler: Debates reinforce. If Clinton goes in ahead 55-30, she likely wins by same margin 
HuffPollster bonus from nataliemjb: A preview of polls on next weeks Canadian elections 
HuffPollster: Two polls now find Clinton debate winner, though focus groups amp; social media told different story 
More HuffPost/YouGov: Both Clinton and Sanders impress, but  of Dems who want her to be nominee jumps from 44 to 52 
55 of Democratic voters name Clinton the debate winner in a new HuffPost/YouGov poll 
PollsAndVotes nataliemjb At least thats been my experience. Worth testing on this years data? (3/3) 
PollsAndVotes nataliemjb Internet polls often have a higher undecided because the option is prompted *and* harder to miss (2/) 
PollsAndVotes nataliemjb Undecided is typically lower on IVR (partly because it comes last, sometimes after a delay), and (1/) 
Another icymi 
kwcollins wccubbison Agree. And theres a lot of anti-party at the grassroots of the GOP, many think of themselves as tea-party gt; GOP 
Neglected to credit aedwardslevy, my partner/colleague on the HuffPost/You activist surveys 
Activists: Sanders makes progress convincing his supporters hes viable; 88 of his backers now think he can win 
Activists: As with Dem primary voter polls, Bidens entry would take more support from Clinton than from Sanders 
HuffPost/YouGov activist survey, part II: Sanders gains with Democratic activists, but Clinton still leads

This. Totally agree. Congrats to NBCPolitics and _TargetSmart 
Im not a handicapper, I'm a measurer. There's a difference. Andrew Kohut in 06 on election polling

MattDabrowski Of course not. But let's not pretend that not having the confidence to call something a lead is a "tie" 
For the record, I'm not a fan of "statistical tie." Dear followers, what's your take? 
cmatthewspolls It's actually been available (via gmail's underused "labs" features) for years. Has saved me many, many times. 
Another 16.9 of adults are cell mostly (have both, answer most calls on cell phone); so 61 are cell only/mostly

HuffPollster: Two new CO polls are internal/D sponsored, yes, but their methods are why they deserve a closer look 
JoshdelaRosa1 Probably all RBS, but don't know for certain (IVR didn't ask for a name). But I'm guessing DC's phone match rate is low. 
MikeMadden BrianStryker researchrants fair point -- and, obvs, call was to our landline 
MikeMadden ByronTau If this was intended to personalize mail (ie tailoring to individual voters, not aggregate), it's a huge survey no-no

MikeMadden mikedebonis maustermuhle willsommer fyi:20/20 insight is polling for Brian Hart. See my last 3-4 tweets 
ByronTau Tested 5 positive messages; nothing newsworthy. Seems a little late for a race where most paid adv is via direct mail.

In case its not obvious: Bowsers won. Only question is the size of her margin. 
I did this quickly, but if you take the s for Bowser/Gray by Ward and assume 2010 geog. dist. by ward, points to 42-35 Bowser win 
The brilliantly designed DCBOEE website reports indiv precinct results without any indication whether precinct is fully counted 
Keep in mind, Fenty won 44 citywide in 2014, so Bowser 48 early vote in pcts 1-84 vs Fentys 51 total is good news for her 
Caution!! Early vote precincts counted so far are 1-84. Overall these precincts favored FENTY 51-48 in 2010. Grey won missing pcts 66-33 
Caution on making too much of the early vote count. Per JoeLenski amp; jeremybowers, appears to be missing all of Ward 8 amp; more

Initial DCBOEE results, which look like all early vote: Bowser 48, Gray 29, Wells 11 (9.5K total) 
First DCBOEE results are up 
My precinct - Fenty 81 in 10 mikedebonis: One tape from P8/Palisades: Bowser 371, Gray 64, Evans 62, Wells 34  
ForecasterEnten So whos vote counters are slower? DC or NYC? 
danmericaCNN: DCBOEE [reps] said some results would be posted by - at the latest - 9:30p. 
Gray 86 in 10 RT paulschwartzman: birdy says: PAPER ballots counted in precinct 113 (Hillcrest), the mayor wins 43 percent.

jbplainblog BloombergView Congrats! Great get for Bloomberg! 
 jbplainblog: Hey, folks, news about me this morning: I'm moving all my blogging to BloombergView 
No argument there DavidLauter: MysteryPollster To be clear, I'm big fan of focus grps. But you need polls to avoid being misled. 
DavidLauter jbplainblog Nate_Cohn ConfidenceOfVic added this thread amp; a little more to HuffPollster 
Todays HuffPollster: CBS/NYT polls the uninsured on Obamacare, and a debate on polls vs talking to voters 
skoczela 
Mansfield2016 ThePlumLineGS jbplainblog Nate_Cohn Agree, and not quarreling with it. 
Yes usatoday_polls:...[FGs] As a supplement kind of option, not as a replacement kind of option. That's what you're saying, right? 
kkondik To reduce house effect flakiness, weve filtered all-adult samples. You can un-filter via create your own 
Nate_Cohn There is a third option that blends the two (in a good way): Focus groups. Not quant, but helpful to hear real conversation. 
BrianStryker kwcollins But sure, if we ignore cell only, only interview by LL, thats a huge problem, so not really disagreeing 
BrianStryker kwcollins Im with Collins: Problem is that dual usage (cell/LL) blows up the notion of known probability of selection 
Cell-only  BrianStryker: MysteryPollster CDC releases data 6-12 mo after it's collected (Jan-Jun), so it's probably already 40! 
jon_m_rob ...though popular usage seems limited mostly to those doing pre-election or public opinion (issue) surveys. 
jon_m_rob Im fairly liberal, in my usage but then, I have an obvious bias. That said, it could apply to anyone doing survey research... 
Tricia_Braun Thanks for following, btw 
Tricia_Braun True. Fios? We love the internet connection, but calls sometimes get weird static amp; noise. 
HuffPollster: 38 of adults now cell-only (was lt;5 10 years ago) but that growth may be slowing 
Indeed he id..ForecasterEnten: So as I said on election night, Democrats are likely to sweep VA statewide offices And so it is. 
skoczela aedwardslevy Damn. Had a shot in 2014. 
Interesting theme in my DC twitter list. One of these is not *quite* like the others (cc GhostsofDC) 
johnncastlerock Cant break it out unless pollsters ask it that way. 
Brian_Nienaber The list is of polls that tracked Oct/Nov to Dec

ICYMI, this.. HuffPostData...Two years after the U.S. withdrew its troops, Iraq still looks like a war zone 
HuffPollster: Iowa GOP [hearts] Paul Ryan. Is it too early to care? 
Generic U.S. House poll results are messy. That and other pearls of wisdom in todays HuffPollster 
KSoltisAnderson I use AudioNote (both iOS amp; Mac versions). Synchs audio to typed notes, like Pulse Pen. Would be awesome for FGs. 
HuffPollster: A skeptical take on momentum, floors amp; other approval rating speculation 
Very powerful ambelenky: Must read: "One knock. Two men. One bullet." Beautiful story by jasoncherkis 
HuffPollster: A pollapalooza roundup - Americans are down on nearly everyone in DC 
ForecasterEnten LoganDobson Hmm. Taking that under advisement. The prompt for neither does seem analogous to a prompt for independent. 
LoganDobson Would you exclude NBC/WSJ too? We used to exclude. Question is similar. 
Steven_Nelson50 abaumania He means their result from *November*. 
The plot thickens CBSNewsPoll: Obamas job rating is now 42, up 5 points from his all-time low last month. 50 disapprove. 
HuffPollster: New natl polls have conflicting messages on direction of Obama approval. But trend looks mostly flat 
cmatthewspolls Theyre really friends. Whenever Bo comes out of his cage, Gizzy is there to observe amp; supervise. Acts like hes her bunny. 
Seriously. They've heard about this Social media thing and they're in it to win it... 
With kids home for snow day, our pets, baby bunny Bo and Gizzy, opt to team up and win the Internet 
DrewLinzer aedwardslevy LoganDobson I like cookies, but as a general rule, Id advise pollsters to avoid cooking metaphors. 
HuffPollster: Do pollsters who sample RVs rather than Not Know What Theyre Doing?

Congrats! KSoltisAnderson: This is a pretty neat way to wrap up the year. Thanks, TIME, for the honor. 
HuffPollster: Cant deny, its been very slow day on the polling beat. Also, Jerry Brown is very popular. 
HuffPollster: We take a closer look at Harvards update of its biennial poll of young Americans. 
aedwardslevy goodnewsgoddess And a different question on CNN (will ACA problems be solved?). Lesson: dont rely on just one Q. 
LoganDobson A_H_Goldstein But I think we agree: Googles been working hard to blur the difference amp; easy to miss the + on a written Q 
LoganDobson liz_kantor Agree 
LoganDobson I wonder how many didnt notice the + when reading the question. 
ICYMI: Team HuffPollster wants you! Were looking for a full-time, paid intern for Winter/Spring 2014 
HuffPollster for a slow day: PRC on foreign policy views, students worry about loan debt and...Brian the dog

New Nov. tracking poll from KaiserFamFound finds views on ACA "souring" 
HuffPollster: A collection of support/oppose questions on the filibuster, and a good reason to ignore them 
HuffPollster: Obamas approval drops, searches on Obama approval rise. Plus more on the Census CPS story 
TheRickWilson KSoltisAnderson Still a big drop, but not quite in a month. The 60 was in 9/2012 
Well thank you samsteinhp: You can have your fivethirtyeight or your Nate_Cohn. i'd take MysteryPollster any day of the week 
Nate_Cohn DLeonhardt Congrats Mr. Cohn. Well deserved.

GerryDales aedwardslevy EL_Swan What would be *really* interesting is difference between fav rating of Obamacare and of KYnect 
GerryDales aedwardslevy EL_Swan Agree its some of both. Could get a sense with another Q on familiarity with ACA, but havent seen asked 
SeanTrende jbplainblog Fair point. We tried to avoid setting that up as a disagreement, agree that its not. 
HuffPollster: Two takes on what Obama's approval rating could mean for 2014..and more 
nickgourevitch cmatthewspolls jonward11 Right. BlueLabs just about targeting. Ask only vote amp; certainty. 
jonward11 got a look at BlueLabs polling from July to Nov: never had McAuliffe up by more than 3 points.

HuffPollster has more on the VA polls: SeanTrendes shy Tory effect, EmersonPollings methods and more 
She wasnt making that up EL_Swan: Trapped at my desk by a mob of coworkers behind me chatting up Pauly Shore. Please send help. 
sanbrunamo Redistrict I have 0 evidence (trust Redistrict) but wonder if more aggressive absentee push by Dems -gt; more provisionals 
Redistrict So..739 provisionals *counted* in 09...any idea how many were cast but not counted? 
Redistrict Curious: How many provisionals were there in 12? What was the pattern? And if different than 09, why? 
umphlett53 stuartpstevens jonward11 Best evidence I have is that chart, which included weekend polls and shows no late break 
umphlett53 stuartpstevens jonward11 Yes, our poll tracking model had conf. intervals, but thsoe assume *collectively* accurate polls 
umphlett53 stuartpstevens jonward11 In this thread, neither. Saying its likely that 2-digit Cuccinelli leads were off beyond MoE 
stuartpstevens jonward11 So should polls not exist? Or just not include any warning about their (im)precision? 
jonward11 stuartpstevens See my writeup from Monday, esp. paragraphs before/after the chart 
If youre not following David Wasserman Redistrict) on the ongoing Virginia AG count, youre doing it wrong. 
Highly recommend jonward11s piece on the contrast of internal polls in the VA Gov race. 
baseballcrank jpodhoretz GerryDales btw, see more on point from jonward11 
baseballcrank jpodhoretz GerryDales Fair enough, but I think youre making my point. 
jpodhoretz GerryDales baseballcrank Which polls showed *movement* from 2-digits to 2 points? Id argue 2-digit lead never was. 
HuffPollster: Why the VA margin was closer than polls predicted and our talk with Dem pollster geoffgarin 
KSoltisAnderson Thanks. Worth *something*, I hope. 
ElectProject Curious what poll vote pref was on VA Gov among those who were decided on LG or AG, i.e..too many nonvoting LVs? 
ElectProject Our model for LG was +12, +14 on  of two party voteactual was +10 
HHHElections ElectProject Has  of provisionals has grown since 2005? Someone noted that Cucc AG 2005 didnt change much 
ElectProject How does VA handle provisional ballots? Not yet counted? 
About that slim VA AG margin: On day after 12 election, Obama led by 3.0. Grew to +3.9 on certified count 
micahcohen fivethirtyeight Thanks. Better you than me. Congrats to you both on Bialik - great hire! 
micahcohen Nothing against the other guys 
What happened to the polls in VA? Start with our wrap-up yesterday. Dont be surprised if 
SeanTrende Did they project? 
Latest update of HuffPost VA model: McA 47.5, Cucc 45.9 (+1.6). May still slightly understate McA 
Yep Redistrict: Quite likely TerryMcAuliffe pulls this out, but it's much closer than HuffPollster/RCP polling averages pegged race. 
Our count model for VA now estimates McAuliffe +1.3, may slightly understate his  (see prev tweets) 
Re previous tweets: SeanTrende and Nate_Cohn have been reporitng estimates based on similar sounding models 
2/3 Reason: In big Dem counties in VA, Dems do better as more precincts counted. So McAuliffe *should* gain slightly in our estimate 
2/? Right now, that model shows McAuliffe *slightly* ahead (48.6 to 48.3), BUTsame model understated Obama by 1.5 at this point in count 
1/? Some news: The HuffPostData team created an experimental vote count model for VA w/ combines results with past voting patterns 
LoganDobson :-) 
LoganDobson Thats right..but match happens at precinct level 
Via CNN, new exit poll estimate: 47 McCauliffe, 45 Cuccinelli, 7 Sarvis. Likely reweighted against actual results in samped precincts 
wccubbison Redistrict Nate_Cohn Thanks 
Redistrict Nate_Cohn Just absentee out or also early vote? 
Nate_Cohn Henrico is an AP errorwere on it 
Nate_Cohn kwcollins nytimes derekwillis Note:  of interviews now appears at bottom of page 
2/2 Will be several updates over next 90 mins as they get all interviews and adjust for within-precinct-error. Accuracy jumps as they do. 
1/2 The reason nets wont call on a 7 point e.p. margin is theyre waiting to check errors against actual count in selected precincts 
2) Similarity of margin (+7) to poll averages may be for good reason. See To try to minimize graph here 
Two things 1) Note that a 7 point margin in the exit poll estimate is *not* enough to call the electionby any network 
CNN once again sharing topline estimate JuddLegum: CNN Exit Polls: McAulliffe 50, Cuccinelli 43, Sarvis 7 (via SamFeistCNN) 
TheFix AaronBlakeWP In fairness, NEP did better at anticipating/correcting any early error in 2012...but always best to wait 
Reminder: the HuffPostData 2013 elections results page will have counts on all races, a map amp; scatter plot for VA 
Yep kwcollins: Do the exit poll MOEs account for the cluster sample design effect? 
Probably worth checking my exit poll piece from 2012 Or even 2004 
nickgourevitch AaronBlakeWP Or the more updated version 
nickgourevitch AaronBlakeWP Here you go. Holds up reasonably well 
amyrchapman Nate_Cohn Depends on the state. If the early/absentee  is likely to be significant, they usually do. 
amyrchapman Nate_Cohn Actually, I believe theyve done a phone poll for early/absentee. 
RyanODonnellPA PostPolls You might recall early exit poll data in 2004...President Kerry? 
PostPolls: Early  exit poll results: It's 2012, not 2009 Remember: early exit poll demos can change too 
HuffPollster: The latest on election day 2013 - early vote favors McAuliffe, and how/where to follow results 
bwbensonjr skoczela Thanks. The old machines of Boston amp; Chicago are gone but these mid-day turnout  are their one nice legacy. 
skoczela For those of us unfamiliar with the Ward geography, which candidate benefits from a higher turnout in wards 16 amp; 18? 
DaveAHopkins monkeycageblog Who needs anecdotal turnout reports when we have early vote count from ElectProject? 
Wow. Great hire. Congrats Carl! fivethirtyeight: Exciting news: 538 is hiring CarlBialik, aka the WSJ's "Numbers Guy" 
LoganDobson Got it. Agree. So rare to get something truly qualitative on election day. 
LoganDobson ok...so whats your point? 
Note ElectProjects key takeaway: VA early vote says polls are likely correct in predicting a McAuliffe lead 
For everyone asking, any word on urnout?....ElectProject: My take on what the Virginia  tells us 
HotlineJosh LoganDobson Yes: VA, NJ amp; NYC too. Published by the networks, AP, WaPost, NYTimes, etc 
ConfidenceOfVic ElectProject ForecasterEnten TerryMcAuliffe 
Yes VA, HuffPostData will have an elections result page (w/ scatter plots) tonight + NJ, NYC, Boston amp; more 
ElectProject ForecasterEnten TerryMcAuliffe These are  of votes cast? And what leads you to that conclusion? 
ForecasterEnten Thanks (sent prior tweet before seeing this) 
ForecasterEnten Close, but not quite. See paragraph 3 
Nate_Cohn monkeycageblog A worry of mine too. Confidence of win harder to do, but were working on it. 
letsgokath Yes. Piece describes *public* polls. Mellmans good work was held private. Are VAs internal polls different too? We dont know. 
HuffPollster rounds up the final polls for campaign 2013, including two toss-up races to watch Tuesday night 
monkeycageblog Thank you!! 
skoczela dbernstein Can send more later, but...to the extent that theres a house effect, we dial it back. Harder with fewer polls 
skoczela dbernstein Remember, a 56 probability of lead is teeny bit better than a 50/50 coin-flip. A true toss-up. 
More upgrades! Our Boston mayor chart now running the SimonJackman model - total tossup:

HuffPollster: The new NBC/WSJ poll and, per aedwardslevy, every conceivable Halloween pollster pun 
Einstein...and one awesome waffle, ready to seek candy!! 
Theres also an overlooked silver lining for polling nerds in the varying VA results  read to the end 
h/t to sfcpoll for the polls arent herding 
HuffPollster: A deeper dive on the non-herding Virginia polls. Plus the obvious exit poll pun. 
My quick take: Two VA polls tell very different stories about the size of McAuliffes lead 
HuffPollster: Dem leaning LVs in VA defy conventional wisdom, but trend matches Cuccinellis dwindling ad spending 
HuffPollster: Little suspense about NYC mayors race, but in Boston yet another odd twist on a poll story

Also re Wenzel VA poll: Its 35 age 65+. Way too high. 09 exit poll was 18 10 voters were 25 65+ on voter file
