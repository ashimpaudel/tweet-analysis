. @realDonaldTrump is shockingly dim when it comes to obvious stuff. Another good reason not to let him near the nuke codes!
I guess they didn't teach Common Sense at Wharton when @realDonaldTrump was there. Sad!
(BTW we had no idea abt that til the ad got covered we were getting emails saying nasty stuff abt Melania from @realDonaldTrump supporters).
"Clue up, @realDonaldTrump-- not a lot of Mormon women voting in WI. Though I get your own base has worse view of Melania than me/LDS ladies."
.@realDonaldTrump must think I'm as dumb as the idiots he hires if he thinks I'd keep an ad targeting Mormon women up past Tuesday.
"Only reason people are still writing+talking abt it is YOU;it hasn't run for DAYS. If you want focus to end, stop talking! @realDonaldTrump"
"Hey @realDonaldTrump: Our ad came down at 5/6PM local time in UT/AZ on TUESDAY, as originally scheduled."

".@tripgabriel @rickhasen @Bencjacobs But given that women supporting Trump obv not cool w Melania GQ spread, all for him publicizing our ad."
".@tripgabriel @rickhasen @Bencjacobs Sure it is. I'm just saying, it's not like this is a *new* line of attack for Trump. Predates our ad."
".@rickhasen @Bencjacobs @tripgabriel But sure, why not use it as pretext to go nuclear on H Cruz w BS he's been feeding to Trumpkins 4 days."
".@rickhasen @Bencjacobs @tripgabriel His campaign has been whining to supporters about it for days now, urging them to send me hate mail."

".@daveweigel That ad ran in Arizona, too... That's where I'm thinking he may underperform."
".@amandacarpenter Also looks like Trump is going to underperform 2nite, thanks to the ad. Otherwise, why start whining &amp; making threats now?"
".@amandacarpenter That's not my opinion, or that of the women we tested it w before running it. Turns out Trump has a problem with his base."
".@amandacarpenter ..and no joke, 90% of the Trumpkins emailing me about that ad indicate that they think that photo shoot was deeply immoral"
.@amandacarpenter Yup. Trump team has done a PHENOMENAL job of getting our ad way more attention than we ever would have...
...b/c @realDonaldTrump knows there's a little thing called defamation law. Which doesn't apply to our ad bc the Melania pic is real. LOLZ.
"Presumably, the reason @realDonaldTrump hasn't said what his campaign has apparently been pushing his followers to say about Heidi..."
"Trumpkins whining about our ad have been referencing this in lots of emails to you. There, @realDonaldTrump, consider your ""thunder"" stolen."
Donald Trump is so desperate to beat Cruz that his team has been pushing around rumors she's a criminal w a mental illness for weeks now.
".@realDonaldTrump Hi Donald, I know you're really upset about that ad, but it was Make America Awesome's, not Ted Cruz's."
@RobertBluey This is so funny to me because so many lobbyists are so utterly ineffective.
"So, yes, I can live with that result. Now, Trumpkins, get back to calling me a ""tranny k-ke,"" please."
"Furthermore, still getting indicators the ad is working with the target audience, only really irritating existing Trump voters + liberals."
"All of it takes issue with my being mean for running the ad; much of it asks if I/any of my family have never made a ""mistake"" like her w ad"
90pct of it contains statements indicating the sender strongly disapproves of that photo shoot/her having posed nude and/or handcuffed.
Interesting... just audited my Melania-ad related hate mail from self-described Trump supporters.
".@emilycrockett You should have reached out for one in the first place. It's called basic journalistic standards. But sure, I'll email you."

".@emilycrockett And you're the one using the word, not me. Personally, I wish everyone would cut that word out of their vocabulary."

"...and we have indicators that for them, Melania posing nude is disturbing and bothersome. I'm fine w her having done it, but they're not."
"All right people, I'm logging off for the night. But again, I'll reiterate: That ad is targeted to Mormon women..."
"@normative @mckaycoppins Well, get ready to get depressed, because they are in some quarters."
"@TheMikeYikes @HouseCracka @GOP Oh come on, my hair is so much more like Paul's."
".@BuzzFeedAndrew I don't use that word, and I haven't used it about Melania. But it's a fact that Mormon women aren't cool w this."

.@emilycrockett I'm fine w Melania's prior work. But I'm not a Mormon woman. I also want to defeat her husband.
.@emilycrockett ... that's your call. The truth is that Mormon women aren't going to be sold on her as First Lady given nude modeling.
".@emilycrockett for the record, I didn't call or suggest that Melania is a ""sl-t"" (a word I don't use). If that's what you think of her..."

"@KristenSkrenes ?? In IL, the delegates are actually on the ballot. Am I misunderstanding you?"
@nickgillespie he was pretty good at hunting
"BTW, that's exactly why we engaged there. Complicated = opportunities to pick off delegates through very strategic spending."
"The key thing with Illinois is not who won, but what the actual delegate count looks like. It's a very complicated setup there."
".@EricKleefeld @joshtpm So would I! But I am not the Pope, nor anyone in any official Catholic Church capacity :)"
".@EricKleefeld @joshtpm Unlike, say, Presbyterians, who are actually pretty different on many more key things."

"Of course, these are the same people who haven't figured out that Scott Walker won his recall race (on which I consulted)..."

".@WolfAlphaProjct @UncuckTheRight But I've long been supportive of Cruz, including back before he even ran for Senate. He won that, BTW."
.@WolfAlphaProjct @UncuckTheRight I voted for Rubio in VA bc that was the best shot at blocking Trump/keeping his delegate count down.
".@WolfAlphaProjct @UncuckTheRight I've never worked for Rubio or any political effort affiliated with him, you moron. I'm more pro-Cruz."
"@MadeleineGSLAK Well, there's an incoherent thought for the night."

"(For the record, I'm not arguing for big government ""solutions"" to economic problems, and I believe Dems screwed up plenty, too)."
"I will never be for Trump, but there is an element of people in DC (including many Rs) having done things to give rise to this years ago."

"@Sajizzle @mattklewis GOP leaders keep endorsing others, rejecting + trashing Trump. He's getting support from non-Rs. It's obvious."
@CashBama @Cheri_Kentucky @conncarroll @HotlineJosh I don't care what Trump said on TV. Cops say they didn't tell him to cancel. Read up.
@CashBama @Cheri_Kentucky @conncarroll @HotlineJosh You need to read the AP story about CPD saying they did not advise him to cancel.
@Sajizzle @mattklewis ...you will have missed it. It entails reading and examining a lot.
@Sajizzle @mattklewis There's been plenty of McCain-like rejection. You just haven't noticed it. Unless u track this stuff daily (I do)...
@CashBama @Cheri_Kentucky @conncarroll @HotlineJosh The CPD told AP last night that they didn't advise him to cancel Chicago. Read up.
@hunteramor  I don't have an answer yet
@Sajizzle @mattklewis I disagree with this. A few of our guys have. Most have actively rejected them.
"@Sajizzle @mattklewis But historically, he's been more aligned w Dems. He's a phenomenon disconnected from parties. He really is."
"@Sajizzle @mattklewis GOP in general hasn't. Trump and a handful of others have, and then Trump decided to run as an R."
"@Sajizzle @mattklewis And many of the Rs who won downticket post-2008 are the ones who supported immigration reform. See: Rubio, Marco."
"@Sajizzle @mattklewis relatively few Trump voters were even Republicans until relatively recently. Aggrieved Indys, Dems."
@Sajizzle @mattklewis Im not saying there's not racism. I'm saying it's not a GOP function so much as other things.
"@Sajizzle @mattklewis And FWIW, some white working class feeling econ anxiety, getting angry are w Bernie. V few POC in his camp, also."
@CashBama @Cheri_Kentucky @conncarroll @HotlineJosh Reports last night were he said he canceled Chicago bc CPD advised him to.
@Sajizzle @mattklewis It's not... the non-white working class portion feeling anxiety already in Obama's camp.
"@Sajizzle @mattklewis But sure, I think Jeff Sessions (who's endorsed Trump) hasn't been helpful on immigration. Others too, to a degree."
"@Sajizzle @mattklewis Also, original birthers (Phil Berg, Orly Taitz, Trump) were all Hillary people. It's an uncomfortable fact."
"@Sajizzle @mattklewis The RNC autopsy was post-2012 loss, and so was Gang of 8."
"@ASFried @mattklewis I'm aware. I just think here, Trump = Wallace, and someone else = Nixon. Maybe Hillary (scary!)"
"@Sajizzle @mattklewis Trumpers are motivated by overall economic anxiety, sense white working class falling behind. Not GOP on immigration."
"@Sajizzle @mattklewis See RNC autopsy, Rs got Gang of 8 passed, Ryan strongly pro-immigration."
"@Sajizzle @mattklewis Actually, GOP at large has been positioning as very pro-immigration reform up until quite recently."
@darylmox @conncarroll @HotlineJosh Wasn't arguing w you. You chimed in.
"@conncarroll @HotlineJosh In any event, Truump indicated cops told him to cancel Chicago. Which is not true."
"@conncarroll @HotlineJosh And they might have canceled Chicago, but since it's so beneficial to Trump narrative-wise, reason to doubt that."
"@conncarroll @HotlineJosh Yes re Cincy, but it's not clear it was protester-related per se. Sounds as tho they just didn't have enuf time."
@writerjt I'd have to rewatch it to say.
"@darylmox @conncarroll @HotlineJosh It's not an angle of attack, it's just pointing out a fact. Guy is a serial liar."
"@mattklewis I suspect the majority of Americans, as in late 60's, look at situation and say ""God, what is wrong w our country."""
"@mattklewis I tend to think this is true. Flipside is I do see and hear people who were open to Trump who are like ""uh, all that looks bad."""
".@conncarroll @HotlineJosh Also pretty evident now that Trump wasn't ""forced"" to cancel Chicago. Beneficial to him coverage-wise that he did"
.@conncarroll @HotlineJosh This doesn't make clear it was canceled bc of worries about protester violence/protester-Trumpette clashes.

"@icouldbeahacker @kwfelsher @emzanotti @mattbai Those are Trump's voters (and Bernie's, to a large extent) in a nutshell."

"Ah yes, of course... blame the JOOOOOOOS! https://t.co/yUz6u6LuXD"
Anyone who thinks at this stage Trump isn't the world expert at changing the subject while keeping all media eyes on him is a moron.
@DreadCrash You actually want the protesters unorganized and out of control. Which is what they appeared to be.
"Do NOT let Trump change the subject. Sure, let him say what he has to say re: protesters. Then ask him about Fields/Lewandowski/footage."
Reporters and media covering Chicago and Trump should NOT drop the ball on Fields/Lewandowski. All part of the same story.
"@justkarl It looks like he was up to something, and it will prompt more questions."
@justkarl I think there's more chance it will now that the AP report that the CPD didn't recommend canceling is getting around.
"@ThePaulTown On his part? Never. On my part? Don't like campaign analysis, follow someone else."

"Yeah, media SHOULD be asking about Fields in the context of this. But they're not. Focusing on the last couple hours, only."
"Another point: Look how now, Trump has changed the subject from Lewandowski/Fields. Clever, no?"
"@justkarl @ChuckLane1 @HotlineJosh It's not, but it's how Trump himself thinks. And he drives the train."
@JJBills14 Here's what I'll say: America deserves better than all of this BS.
@Scottgas2 I've never said Trump was dumb. He's a pretty smart guy. He's just very wrong on policy. And can't spell well in tweets.
.@ChuckLane1 @HotlineJosh That was presumably exactly the point. Allows him to validate his statements that it's protesters that are violent
"Trouble here is, the reason it worked is because Trump was right. Chicago has a lot of people who are willing to go WAY OTT on all sides."
"...and then what would ensue would prove correct (or close enough) to validate his claims that protesters are violent, not his supporters."
"My guess is the reason Trump did it as a ticketed event open to public is he knew nutty, way OTT Chicago opponents of his would show..."
"I like Chicago a lot. But it's not exactly somewhere full of peaceful, serene, calm people who never go OTT w their political expression."
"@emzanotti @GrannySkywalker Basically, what this tells me is Chicago is still as much a hot mess as in 1968."

"@kwfelsher @emzanotti Yes, it does work two ways, and the two sides who both dig it their way clashed tonight."
@rjPHX That's true.

@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro Right. This is what I'm saying.

"@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro The reason people are pro-gay-marriage isn't bc of ""frame,"" it's bc they know loving, committed gay couples"
"@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro People like the idea of the rule of law, but they don't want the friends/fellow congregants deported."
"@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro Reality is, a lot more Rs know and have relationships w unauthorized than 30 yrs ago."
"@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro Reality is, evangelical churches have far more unauthorized immigrants in congregations now than 10 yrs ago"
"@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro Actually, I think voters' own personal experiences, not the frame, dictates where they stand."
"@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro And anti-immigration groups are really good at selling the ""Trump's winning, so our position = popular"" BS"
@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro But the press usually gets the story about where GOP voters really are on immigration wrong...
".@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro I agree that voters are somewhat confused on immigration- often like the sound of ""enforce law""+""amnesty"""
"@Gravantus Yeah, that's why I got Scott Walker through the recall, helped Tories win in UK. You're so right, genius."
@warnerthuston I'm sorry
".@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro ...even in the GOP, as my NY Post piece demonstrates (and as corresponds to my political experience)."
".@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro And that is simply false, and is not backed up by data. Truth is, amnesty a more winning position..."
".@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro Yup. Yet we act like everyone who's for Trump/Cruz is an imm hardliner, therefore 60% of GOP = hardliners."
".@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro I see this time and again in polling and focus groups, public and private."
".@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro ...when the reality is, they usually support that person for other reasons to a larger degree."
.@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro Imm is the one issue where we assume everyone supporting an anti-imm hardliner also = imm hardliner...
.@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro Yes... very possibly for reasons that have nothing to do w immigration. Few people vote on immigration.
".@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro Intensity of feeling AGAINST Mexicans are rapists stuff is also very high-- obv outside GOP, but in, too"
.@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro And that includes a big chunk in the GOP. Probably more among cons than Trump's angry moderates.
.@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro I'd also note that polling shows that voters do have hard/fast feelings about mass deportation: AGAINST IT
"@NickRiccardi @normative @jbarro Truth is, even in this environment, ""amnesty"" still a more winning position than the opposite. Even in GOP."

"(And I don't support mass deportations, and think legal immigration, and fines/back taxes to get on pathway to citizenship = good)."
"(For the less smart out there, that last tweet was satire. My nanny is a very awesome African-American lady from Virginia)."
".@jbarro They're rapists, but if they code, let them in, just make them pay for a wall, and we deport Disney and refugees but not my nanny."

"@SAKREV @benshapiro @Soldierjohn Not the whole way around, and security is loose. I've entered it repeatedly, just walking right in."
@GeraldVonGustav I didn't. Tell Trump.
"@AVoiceofReason That is a depiction of a legal border. Come on, you know I'm right about this. You can walk right into Vatican City."
@GeraldVonGustav Because you're being silly and overlooking really basic stuff like the difference between a state and museums?
"@SAKREV @benshapiro @Soldierjohn Ive actually been there and done this many, many times."
@SAKREV @benshapiro @Soldierjohn That don't extend the whole way around/which you can walk through basically at-will.
"@ShidelerK I'm not opining on what Trump wants, I'm just saying, he has a key fact wrong."

"@AVoiceofReason Um, no. I mean Via della Conciliazione. How can you be unaware of this?"

"@Mellecon @largebill68 But they don't want to keep people out, so your point is moot. Anyone can basically stroll right in."

"@johnwcbragg In some places, sure. But it's incorrect to suggest VC is 100% sealed off from Italy by a wall. It's not. And easy to enter."

@Mellecon @largebill68 Who also don't stop people just walking into Vatican City...

"@convoice Yes, I was using shorthand. 140 character limit."

"@jenny_aplin That's to get into specific buildings, not to get into Vatican City, which you can walk right into, and I have done repeatedly"
@ChiNewsBench @dalegrounds @benshapiro The wall doesn't extend all the way round and you can walk right in. They already have.
"@tedtidwell Which has nothing to do with the presence of walls. We could have a wall on US-Mexico border, but you couldn't move into WH."

"@emzanotti @SomeKindaBoogin @PwnParrot The Swiss Guards don't do shit except stand around, unless you're trying to attack Pope."
But if you're a Catholic 1) try to get to Rome and 2) don't be urging the Pope to tear down a wall separating VC and Rome that doesn't exist
"I mean, I would not expect @realDonaldTrump the Presbyterian who thinks Communion is the part where you hand over cash to know this, duh."

"@Wodun001 @colvinj Haha, maybe, but she's definitely got the future hard-ass border guards, I think!"
"@linderje Oh, of course, he's not single issue. I'm just saying, Labrador wouldn't ever endorse, say, Jeff Sessions for President."
"@SirPaulTown ...in other anti-Semitic rhetoric and tropes, you don't get to argue dumping as ally only Jewish state wo looking anti-Semitic."
@SirPaulTown When you are supported and endorsed by white nationalists + supremacists like Trump + have his record of dabbling...
"@SirPaulTown Plus, that policy proposal and lingo is well-recognized and documented to frequently come from overt, admitted anti-Semites."
@SirPaulTown ...but it's not possible to nix an alliance with them without it being anti-Semitic.
"@SirPaulTown Israel is a Jewish state. The only one. That's not why I personally am generally pro-Israel, see them as a useful ally..."
"@SirPaulTown But let's ignore those things: If Japan went from being allied with Israel to treating it neutrally, that would be anti-Jewish."
"@SirPaulTown 1) Japan doesn't have a military that operates outside its borders, so not comparable 2) Japan has major anti-Semitic history"
"@Cliff_Bustria It's also why Trump tried to hire me, post 3/15, and it's also why some of your investments are undoubtedly more secure."
"@Cliff_Bustria Correct. I'm very good at what I do, which is why I keep the business of discerning, successful, strong businesses."
"@Cliff_Bustria  That's not what your boy Trump thinks. But as I've made and will make not one cent off our PAC, I kinda agree."
"@CplSoletrain @mstonemja Well, insofar as Trump says highly contradictory, meaningless, and nonsensical shit all day long, maybe so."
"@davidbaughman @freddoso  Oh, sure he would. He was also a pro-Obama blogger and said Romney was too anti-immigrant."
@e_the_o @Ricky_Vaughn99 @Crush1134 ...but needs more than an $8k total spend to actually beat him using it.
"@e_the_o @Ricky_Vaughn99 @Crush1134 That, as in NH, wouldn't be ""victory."" Iowa was ""victory."" NH was just proof our approach works..."
"@panzerbunny457 @SirPaulTown  Now, getting around to muting you, for your own benefit."
"@panzerbunny457 @SirPaulTown  Also, FWIW, the real knock is ""Panzer Bunny"" is you're likely an anime freak."
"@panzerbunny457 @SirPaulTown (Scots don't say ""Oy vey,"" but nice assumption about who I am based on my last name + what it sounds like to u."
"@panzerbunny457 @SirPaulTown Can't take a little needling eh? BTW, I'm a Catholic Scottish-American and your anti-Semitism is showing again."
"@original_cracka @SirPaulTown  I'll say ""more,"" straight up. It's part of reform I favor. No dishonesty here."
"@ariestanc I think size is a huge problem. Individuals who have run and been elected are often crap, too, though."
"@mstonemja @CplSoletrain ..as he did and is quoted as saying in that Hill piece qualifies, for starters. We don't treat ""allies"" ""neutrally"""
"@mstonemja @CplSoletrain Saying you're going to switch from treating an ally as an ally to ""neutrally"" as against one of their antagonists.."
@doxx2date I don't think either Trump or Rand would agree to that.
"@panzerbunny457 @SirPaulTown but please carry on with your uninformed Jew hating, guy with a handle fittingly named for a German tank. Mute."
"@panzerbunny457 @SirPaulTown 4) Israel is tremendously good at taking out terrorists efficiently. We benefit from that, very clearly."
"@panzerbunny457 @SirPaulTown 3) democracy there has contributed to a lot of private investment ties, which are worth sustaining."
@panzerbunny457 @SirPaulTown 1) pls get familiar w Israeli geography. Not just sand... Lots of ag there. 2) democracies share for pol goals.
"@panzerbunny457 @SirPaulTown that's true. But the religion is not why we should support them, it's just why people like you don't want to."
"@panzerbunny457 @SirPaulTown but yeah, clear you are an anti-Semite to a degree at least from your language, views on why we'd ally..."
"@panzerbunny457 @SirPaulTown here's one: They're a democracy in a part of the world where there are basically none, so shared values there."
"@panzerbunny457 @SirPaulTown nope, but thinking that's why we support them is a good tell you hate Jews. Bye now!"
"@Cliff_Bustria be careful, if you own any stock in Fortune 500s, you are probably indirectly my client and I kick ass for you every day."
"@SirPaulTown the non-anti-Semitic position = Israel is our ally (they are, for now, anyway; guess not under Trump; not ""neutral"" to allies)."
@SirPaulTown it is broadly recognized as anti-Semitic code language.
"@Cliff_Bustria you lack Twitter followers, logic, and a coherent political philosophy. Oh well!"
@linderje I'm not assuming. I have knowledge from my work on immigration.
Of course he will. Gotta keep that anti-Semite vote... https://t.co/HxZtMS2fTs
"Specifically, Labrador wouldn't likely endorse Cruz unless he believed he was for path to legalization. https://t.co/J1Tg7s1STv #justsaying"
Labrador worked extensively to get imm reform. Wouldn't be endorsing if he didn't think Cruz was for more imm. https://t.co/J1Tg7s1STv
"@esjacobs All good. I'm a very active tweeter, so sometimes specific tweets can be missed in a deluge :)"
"@misterladygaga Hahahahaha, yeah. Keep telling yourself that."
".@RealDeal4US Thank you, thank you! We're also up on TV in Nevada... People should watch River Monsters and the First 48 tomorrow."
"@Crush1134 In Iowa, we did a lot of damage with what was literally like a $4k spend. No wonder his people threatening to sue over our ads."
"@Crush1134 Best consolation for you is this: No one has written us a check for $200k. But if someone does, we will do real damage."
"@Crush1134 Grafton. He just edged 30%. Lowest percentage he got in any county in the state. Sorry, but our stuff is working, if small-scale."
"@jonalft No, they think I'm Jewish, so I guess from tel Aviv? Who knows."
"@wakeupfla Sad fact is, Trump has exact same economic policy positions as Clinton and in some cases Sanders. He is the liberal onslaught IMO"
"@wakeupfla Trump does not forgive, nor forget. But it's nice to know you do. Still won't be getting behind him tho..."
"@NegXer0 Honestly? ""Could I revive Margaret Thatcher, make her American, and run her?"" But I think that's a dodge :)"
"@esjacobs I've said this repeatedly: No. I will vote third party, or write myself in. I write in a lot here in Dem machine Arlington VA."
"@NegXer0 There are lots of options. I will think about it and come back to you tomorrow, how's that?"
@Politics_Matter Thank you! Will you help us out by giving $25 to buy more ads? https://t.co/yEBniio4VJ
"@misterladygaga I'm right. And re: hair style, you first."
@primetimecrime @SnafuWorld ...the vast majority of less-skilled white workers will not even apply for many of those jobs.
"@primetimecrime @SnafuWorld It is a serious question raised by a lot of data. Unfortunate, but true that even when wages rise a lot..."
".@SnafuWorld Actually, that's false. Trump likes Obamacare for biz purposes, but in himself, he's a total single-payer champion and advocate"
.@SnafuWorld Trump sure does! Happy as hell to ditch employer-provided insurance and send everyone onto the shitty exchanges!
".@mikeliberation Oh wow, yes, taking a call from a confused volunteer and spending 10 seconds on it was really painful for me. You're dumb."
@NegXer0 Oh wow... I will have to think on that! Big potential pool!
"@Crush1134 I know it's hard to keep up when you're trying to boost Trump at every turn and facts make your job impossible, but please do try"
"@Crush1134 No, we ran it all along the VT border and in the North, but we ran it most extensively in that county, just like our digital ads."
"@Conservatronic Actually, that's what I do. I deal from strength. Trump complains, sues, and acts like a gigantic whining crybaby."
"@mstonemja But yeah, dumping 80%+ of my principles to work for Trump, who I think would be a bad Prez, just for $$ would be no integrity."
"@mstonemja The only person I agree with 100% is me. 90% best I've ever hit w any candidate. I'll take 80% in most races, incl this one."
"@mstonemja You don't have to agree with someone 100% in order to vote for them, or in order to have integrity."
"@mstonemja But sometimes, the 10th amendment and 14th amendment don't lead the same route. I think CATO had right argument on gay marriage."
"@mstonemja And BTW, that's Cruz's biggest criticism: SCOTUS dumped 10th amendment w that decision. Arguably correct."
"@mstonemja My preference would absolutely have been to legalize it, through legislation/ballot initiative, state by state."
"@mstonemja And no, Cruz isn't fighting SCOTUS on gay marriage. He has a different legal interpretation to what I do, and that's fine."
"@mstonemja I've put $2700 of my own money into my anti-Trump group, and am making no $$ off it, nor will I. Yes, I have integrity."
@BanditGolf Yep. Lots of complementary efforts ongoing.
"@ChasFlemming @justkarl Thanks. Thankfully, I don't need one :)"
"@mstonemja Rubio's position on abortion is to the right of most Americans'. But then again, Hillary's position is way to the left of most."
"@mstonemja That's not my position, but his position is philosophically consistent, IMO. Not an integrity issue, just a ""what sells"" issue."
@Politics_Matter Not sure. We're not on his team. I'm just talking about our ads.
@mlxfl @Thanks! Consider donating? https://t.co/yEBniio4VJ
"@wakeupfla Uh no, you and he wouldn't, and I'd rather blow my brains out, as it stands. I have principles and integrity."
"@mstonemja In other words, I have a client conflict that means I couldn't work for Kasich as it stands, even if I wanted to (I don't)."
"@mstonemja Not a Kasich fan, plus two of my clients hate him and have employed us to block parts of his budgets for a couple cycles now."
"@Barack_McBush That said, I've long believed Trump's whole candidacy is at least in part about trying to deliver a Hillary win, so we'll see"
