Certainly not in a self imposed diet exile. Thats ridic! 
Isn't it just called maternity leave? If coming to NYC support my husband amp; have so enjoyed my time at home with my babies amp; family. 
So I'm reading The Daily Mail, which I love btw but this headline isn't cool. "Kim emerges from self imposed diet exile" REALLY?!

I'm grateful to God for this miracle amp; no matter what rumors or comments you throw my way this time they truly don't affect me! 
amp; luckier to not have preeclampsia so far, so I don't have the swelling issue! They also say your body carries a boy different than a girl 
I've learned to love my body at every stage! I'm going to get even bigger amp; that's beautiful too! I'm blessed to even be pregnant! 
U know me well enough 2know I would document the process if I got a surrogate.Everyone's body is different,every pregnancy is very different 
Some days I'm photographed before I eat amp; look smaller, some days I've just eaten amp; I look bigger. It's all a part of the process. 
First they say I'm too skinny so I have to be faking it...Now they say I'm too big so I have to be faking it...SMH!
