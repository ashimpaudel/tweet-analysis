"@yummymuscle No light can escape - but before matter falls into the event horizon a black hole, it releases fireworks of X–rays."
@Mr_Bob_FTW Think of a black hole as a singularity of almost infinite density.  Wormhole would be a tunnel to another part of the universe.
"@Downtowngoose Nothing, not even light, can escape from a black hole. So it all gets swallowed beyond the event horizon."
"@BigCatSwox You can think of the blackness of a black hole as a dark sphere, since everything inside that radius is lost forever."
@tommyvlaming Quasar = light emitted from hot material that swirls around a black hole *before* it falls in past the event horizon.
"@1199Zizo It’s all at the center of the black hole, in a region of almost infinite density."
"@NorinradPedro They can turn through a full 180 degrees, and if they pass at JUST the right distance can go into permanent orbit around it."
@Donengene Black holes can evaporate unless fed! This is one of Stephen Hawking’s greatest contributions to science.

TOMORROW: @StationCDRKelly &amp; @Astro_Kjell perform 2nd #spacewalk! Here are 7 things to know: https://t.co/7PXkcfFYF6 https://t.co/2pEQUFYy7t
@ddubb710 The radiation environment on the surface of Mars is something that we're monitoring with @MarsCuriosity
@murmaidsci88 We do know that it had a field because there are parts of the ancient Mars crust that are still magnetized.
"@Dustin_LongNJ We believe that the atmosphere that was lost, has been lost forever to interplanetary space."
@gau3tam7 Earth’s magnetic field largely protects it from these processes.
@BWest187 Storms on the sun happen all the time. These storms increase the UV &amp; radiation environment that affect biological life adversely.
@Hamda930 A compass would not point toward North at Mars. It would point toward the nearest and strongest crustal magnetic field.
@Wjkirik The amount of liquid water on Mars is trace amounts. MAVEN is looking on a larger scale.
"@meekelis We see ancient dry river beds, ancient dry lakes - so Mars had to have had a thick atmosphere early on to support liquid water"
@srthvnnn Potentially small amount during the geologically brief time of switch. Earth's bigger w/ more gravity so hard for atoms to escape
@MinaVesperGokal Any small scale magnetic field could potentially deflect local solar wind.
"@MenTor193 It used to. It was small, froze and stopped making a magnetic field."
"@truthordoor Both formed at about the same time, around 4.5 billion years ago."
"@SpeakSpanglish The @Space_Station can see the Earth’s aurora, which are caused by solar winds entering the Earth’s atmosphere."
"@lngsd The Venus atmosphere is very thick. Similar processes are happening there, but so far it’s still a thick atmosphere."
"@Shankovich Yes, MAVEN measured solar wind on the way to Mars. It would depend on the shielding that the spacecraft would have."
"@RussellGarcia The rate of change in the loss is also due to solar activity, which we expect was greater during an early sun."
"@akgadam Magnetic fields originate at the core of planets. Mars is smaller than Earth, so the core had less heat to keep it molten."
@DanielRika2 Earth is bigger &amp; our core hasn't frozen. We still have a global magnetic field on Earth that helps shield us from solar winds
"@BelleBella94 We believe that the Mars atmosphere and climate were significantly different billions of years ago, so yes."
"@CodyWillming Billions of years, at the current escape rate."
@extrapale That is part of MAVEN’s investigation. We hope be able to estimate this.
@GunzSonny It’s very unlikely that this would happen. We think much of it was blown away forever.
@DigitalAbdullah MAVEN science results will help us understand and shape what astronauts will be studying at Mars.
@yudisz It widely varies. Summertime at the equator it can get to as high as 10 degrees celsius. But in general it’s much below freezing.
"@Tekk45 Not directly, but understanding where the water went on Mars helps figure out where the resources are for future astronauts."
@WindmarkUS We don’t know for sure. But we think that Mars' core was small and froze because there was less heat to keep it molten.
"@elakdawalla (2/2) There have been surprises. We've seen unexpected diffuse auroras, transient metal layers in the atmosphere &amp; others."
"@elakdawalla In general, the models of the solar wind interaction w/ Mars' atmosphere have been largely validated. (1/2)"
"@Brummo Global magnetic fields form in the cores of planets. Mars' core is comparatively small and froze, so it's magnetic field ceased."

"@mikelcal So far we’ve detected perchlorates, but there could be other minerals present."
"@SkylarMile All we can see from orbit is what’s on the surface of Mars, and we see evidence of flowing water."
"@brandonbolaa The brine slopes were seen in 2010, but the spectral detection of molecular water was a few months ago."

"@astanzo Yes, we could use this technique on other planetary bodies to find minerals including water."
"@robmantic1 We are detecting salt crystals with molecular water in them, which leads us to believe that the water would not be pure."
"@Scottysthemann There is water on Mars that we could extract, and we hope to identify resources to extract it on future missions."

"@saragreen2013 We've found iron, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen on Mars. Where water interacts with rocks, there is more diversity of mineral."
"@swilson191 Could be, but further investigation is needed to determine where the water is coming from. Updates here: http://t.co/5Qjnv9Tswu"
"@themurphmaster There is some oxygen on Mars, but it is a very small concentration compared to the CO2. There wouldn’t be enough to breath."
@tomerz073 We took images of the dark features and corrected the images pixel by pixel to detect hydration features: http://t.co/rtbAm1Zo4U
"@ThQueen_Rihanna We want to try to narrow down where the water came from, and we'll also look for similar areas on Mars."
@Kenfohh We don’t know for sure because we don't know how deep the water goes. But we do have some ways to estimate.
"@Luke_huckerby Since the atmosphere is so thin, crops would need some type of enclosure to provide pressure."
"@eleni_nasa Not necessarily on the Mars 2020 rover, but we do plan to continue to study the water on Mars."
"@ShanilSchool At some point in the past, there was a lot of water on Mars. We believe some is still below the surface."
@SamanthaJoint The great thing is that it’s water near the equator where it’s slightly warmer than the poles.
@chethanIN It depends on how salty it is. We just don’t know yet. It would likely need to be purified.
@Lganme We need to find out where the water comes from and get closer imaging of the dark streaks.
@Burnzy0909 Maybe. It all depends on how saturated with salt the water is. Life as we know it couldn't survive if too salty.
"@havall73 We think a full water cycle existed billions of years ago. We haven’t seen rain, but we have seen snow."
@renrins @MarsCuriosity @MarsOpportunity We've found similar features within the range of the rover. No plan to do that yet.
"@Meredith7morgan We haven’t seen rain, but we have seen snow. We do think a full water cycle existed billions of years ago."
"@thisisrachels We think the water does evaporate. Because of the salt, it happens must slower. The source of water is the big question."
"@KC_2020 We detected water. It's not circumstantial. We want to go and investigate, but there are no specific mission planned... yet."
@dragonborn2112 There is water. The features we're seeing on Mars are indeed caused from water flow.
@denzvryan This is the first detection. Instruments on @MarsCuriosity will help us understand some of the features - an indirect study.
"@RickyAu6 Not yet, but we will explore the possibility of learning more about this discovery."
"@Babababibux In the summer, the temperature can be above freezing. The salt in the water make it more stable."
@T_C_B_1992 This is the first detection of liquid water. We'll have to wait and see what comes from future discoveries.
@mashallight We  may be able to break apart the H2O for future astronauts. It's not in the atmosphere.
