Bernie Sanders is going to “reassess” his candidacy after tonight. But using terms like “reassess” means he’s staying in the race until 6/7.
"Pennsylvania hasn’t mattered in a primary since the Liberty Bell cracked. #SuperTuesday matters. Geaux vote in PA, MD, CT, RI and DE. @CNN"

It’s quite possible that the GOP can prevent Donald Trump from clinching the nomination. But can they run “Not Trump” as a candidate?
The time to stop Mr.Trump was back before GOP candidates (like Mitt Romney) routinely sought his endorsement and others sought a bromance.
"Since I'm in the New Jersey (Garden State), Donald Trump will never forget what Chris Christie did for him. But neither will anyone else."
"The GOP is caught between a rock &amp; a hard place. If Cruz’s campaign sputters out, then all they have to deal with is that damn hard place."
Rubio is becoming Trump in order to attack Trump. The really distressing part is that he really seems to be enjoying it. #GOPDebate
"In the last #GOPDebate, Rubio landed a few punches, but all that he proved was that Donald Trump can take a punch. And win more states..."
The good news is Gov. John Kasich will try to look presidential. Bad news—that doesn’t seem to be what people are looking for. #GOPDebate
"Tonight's #GOPDebate will be interesting, and the reaction to tonight should be even more interesting tomorrow. You can watch that @CNN."
Can the GOP live with #DonaldTrump? That’s a literal question—can the Party survive if he is their candidate? #GOPDebate

The idea that party bosses will cut off his access to the media or stop Trump from attracting voters who wish him well is entertaining.

"For now, the news, daily chatter, soundbites, as well as the high stake debates favor the Republicans. Will this trend last? Yes!"

The nomination would be considered clinched if this were anybody except #DonaldTrump. Well now it’s looking clinched even if it IS Trump.

"GOP-CAN ANYONE STOP TRUMP?
 
It doesn’t look like anyone can stop Donald Trump, and that includes Donald Trump."
"Still, in Rubio’s favor is the fact that close does count, both in horseshoes and in punditry."
Polls show Donald Trump is very competitive with evangelical voters.  This means Ted Cruz will have to build a new southern firewall.
"Still, Bernie Sanders’ populist message did very well in the #Nevadacaucus. There’s a reason that it’s called “populist. #FeelTheBern"
"DEMOCRATS: Hillary wins #Nevadacaucus 
A win is a win, and win is what she needed.
Nobody minds a close call if the call goes your way."
A few more thoughts: Jeb Bush is out. You can replace Jeb's  exclamation point with a period. End of sentence.
Now Rubio will get all that donor money that had gone to Jeb Bush. And we’ve seen how much good that money did for The Bush campaign.
"Yet another state Senator Marco Rubio didn’t win, and he still gives a victory speech. Can he do that all the way to the GOP convention?"
"#DonaldTrump’s path forward is clear, which is ironic because nobody can figure out how he got this far in winning two states."
"From every conventional viewpoint, Trump did about everything he could possibly do to lose South Carolina, and he still won. That's huge."

I appreciate the work of Move On and others in expanding democracy for all. Thank you for respecting my position on #Superdelegates. Peace!
Final point: I do not support or have given time or money to any #Superpacs. And I am not a paid consultant to the DNC or any party entity.
And I will continue to donate to both presidential candidates. They are my friends and I support the process to elect our nominee.
"Since Al Gore's race in 2000, I have not endorsed or supported a candidate in the primary. I've donated to @BernieSanders &amp; @HillaryClinton"
"Some #Superdelegates have already committed to a candidate, while others are neutral and may choose to not endorse. So, lobby and persuade."
"Like sports, know the rules. If you don't like the rules, speak up before kick-off. This game is underway to elect our nominee for #POTUS."
"@TheDemocrats will work to ensure that every citizen is informed so that you can help us organize, register new voters &amp; run as delegates."
"#Superdelegates do not wear capes or crowns, we are actively working to help elect Democrats from the bottom up. We work with everyone."
The DNC's Rules and Bylaws Committee held open meetings and sessions all across the country. We received good input from party activists.
The process of nominating a candidate for President of  the United States didn't start this year. We started soon after the 2012 election.
"The @TheDemocrats also appointed me to serve on the Rules and Bylaws Committee. Working with state and local parties, and the candidates."
Voter registration and participation of all eligible citizens continue to be my life's work. That's why it's important to #RestoreTheVRA.

"#SuperBowl this weekend. The difference between football &amp; politics is that in politics, there are no penalties for unnecessary roughness."
The GOP candidates want to convince you that the world is falling apart. But it looks more like it’s their Party that might fall apart.
The GOP candidates are like boxers who use Obama &amp; Clinton as punching bags until they are warmed up enough to start punching each other.
The #GOPdebates are like rough and tumble football games—the ones who deliver the nastiest hits aren’t necessarily the winners.
"Barack Obama forged a winning coalition of minorities &amp; millennials. Now #Hillary needs minorities, and #Bernie needs young people to win."

Marco Rubio managed to win by coming in third.  Now Rubio has the wind at his back. All that Ted Cruz has at his back is Donald Trump.
Trump couldn’t translate huge rallies into caucus votes. Too bad for him that there is no state that picks its winner using a rally system.
"As it turned out, the Democratic Caucus in Iowa was every bit as exciting as the Republican Iowa primary."
