@MuhammadAArshad Yes. And does that invalidate my point? Fundamentalist Christianity is dangerous.

@DocSyK The Americans knew the Japanese didn't have the bomb. So deterrence was not an issue.

Normal anti-terrorism measures assume death is a deterrent. But if some loony religion says martyrdom is fast track to heaven . . .
