https://t.co/PbkQZVlxLI"
"To truly honor those lost at Benghazi, we need to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the brave Americans who do their work."
America must do all we can to protect our personnel doing the important work of representing our interests and values around the world.
The work of Chris Stevens and his colleagues represented the best of this approach to foreign policy.
"America must pursue a smart brand of leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense."
"We cannot return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, where military-based solutions are pursued as a first option."
American diplomats cannot conduct their work from bunkers. Advancing US interests often means going to unstable regions.
Hillary is testifying before @HouseBenghazi to defend the vision of US diplomacy that Ambassador Stevens gave his life carrying out.
America must continue to lead in a dangerous world. To do otherwise would mean drawing the wrong lesson from the Benghazi tragedy.
A lesson from Benghazi: Congress needs to do its part to ensure that our diplomats in dangerous parts of the world are as safe as possible.

Cutting off Americans from lifesaving health care at Planned Parenthood is wrong. #standwithPP http://t.co/XQbcLdzbUJ
"The House voting to defund Planned Parenthood is an attack on women's health—nothing more, nothing less. Republicans should be ashamed."

"For a bunch of people who don't believe in acting on climate change, the Republican candidates seem committed to recycling ideas. #GOPdebate"
You don’t have to be a scientist to know that climate change is an urgent challenge that threatens us all. We need to act.
We need commonsense reforms that keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the violently unstable and respect responsible gun owners.

The defining economic challenge of our time is raising incomes. That's how hardworking Americans will get ahead and stay ahead. #GOPdebate
Los estadounidenses que trabajan duro cada día deberían de poder salir adelante. Nuestro desafío económico es aumentar sus salarios.
The GOP's ideas for the economy are just trickle-down economics in disguise. We need a new plan for the 21st century. #GOPdebate
La libertad incluye el derecho de hablar en cualquier idioma. Eso nos hace fuerte como país y es algo que debemos celebrar—no denigrar.

Women—not the politicians on stage—should make decisions about their own reproductive health care. Period. #GOPdebate
Marriage equality is the law of the land. Officials don't have to agree—but they do have to uphold the law. #GOPdebate
America and our allies—especially Israel—will be safer if we enforce the nuclear agreement with Iran.
Tearing up the Iran nuclear deal isn't leadership—it's recklessness.

It’s time we recognize that we have a drug and alcohol addiction epidemic on our hands—and act to address it. http://t.co/t8sDgsOgZS
Our prisons—where 2/3 inmates meet criteria for substance use disorders—are no substitute for treatment. We must reform our justice system.
Our health care system allows too many people with substance use disorders to go without care. We need to invest in treatment.
"23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but only 1 in 10 get the treatment they need. http://t.co/xEy7aZjMTK"
