My take: Nobody else can win enough delegates for nomination, but Clinton amp; Trump rivals aren't going away soon: 
My take: This is going to take a while: For Republicans, because of math. For Democrats, because of message. 
Coincidence? Cruz's "Alaska to Maine" reference to his victories mostly crosses, you know, Canada. 
Lesson: Treating a heckler with humor and respect made Rubio look bigger. 
So HillaryClinton scores a crushing victory in FL--but SenSanders is a message candidate not likely to be deterred by (delegate) math. 
An impressive victory in FL: RealDonaldTrump decisively wins big, diverse, swing state--over two of the most popular GOP pols in the state. 
Or maybe just operational?

This Hillary Clinton victory speech is targeted a lot more at Trump than it is at Sanders.  
Sen. Sanders promises 'Vermont values.' And those are. . . ? 
Sanders isn't going anywhere: '35 states remain, amp; let me assure you that we are going to take our fight...to every one of those states.' 
Telling statement by Sanders? "This campaign is not just about electing a president."

Why NH is hard to predict: Woman at marcorubio town hall in Hudson is trying to decide among Rubio, HillaryClinton and SenSanders. 
Tough night at Saturday's debate, maybe, but hundreds lined up an hour before marcorubio town hall in Hudson.

Obsessively watching the  is what everybody is doing on Saturday night, right? Asking for a friend. 
At  MarthaRaddatz does seem qualified to serve as commander in chief. 
I don't know if GovChristie attacks are going to help him, but they do seem to be rattling marcorubio.  
Whatever you think of his views, realDonaldTrump is the most improved debater over the span of the 2016 campaign. 
Who knew the most emotional topic so far at the  would be eminent domain? (Can Americans find it on a map?) 
At  johnkasich says 'Conservatism should mean...that everybody has a chance to rise.' Strikes themes once sounded by Jack Kemp. 
At  jebbush seems to be taking his mother's advice to interrupt more.  
To the side of the stage at the  johnkasich has his hands in his pockets and is looking around the audience. 
realdonaldtrump promises to 'take care of people dying on the street.' I suspect everybody on stage agrees.  
No issue has been more powerful than immigration in the GOP 2016 race: Boosting realdonaldtrump, dogging marcorubio.  
Why hasn't Jim Gilmore gotten a chance to speak yet?   
At  johnkasich says he can 'promise' his immigration plan would pass Congress: Secure the border, fines for illegals here now. 
  
Meanwhile, JohnKasich hasn't had a chance to speak yet.  
I don't think they like each other: GovChristie and marcorubio tangle fiercely at the  
GovChristie says governors have to deliver. 'They expect you to plow the snow.' marcorubio: You delayed returning to NJ after snowstorm. 
Ready for battle: marcorubio responds to GovChristie criticism of his experience by mentioning the credit rating of New Jersey.  
Dueling lapel pins: GovChristie sports a pin of New Jersey on one lapel, a pin of New Hampshire on the other.  
At  marcorubio mocks standard of experience. Otherwise 'we should rally around Joe Biden. He's been around for a thousand years' 
At  tedcruz apologizes to RealBenCarson but puts blame on CNN for report on Carson's campaign. 
At  realbencarson says he was 'very disappointed' that Cruz team inaccurately spread word in Iowa that he was dropping out. 
'We're going to win with Trump,' says, well, realDonaldTrump. 'People back down with Trump.'  
At  tedcruz dodges question about his criticism on the stump that realDonaldTrump lacks temperament of a commander in chief. 
And we're off:  realDonaldTrump says 'nobody's going to mess with us' if he is commander in chief.

Santorum, his campaign struggling, will break out 'the heavy artillery' Monday: Signature sweater vest will be back.

Trump to Bush: 'It's time to give up, Jeb....He doesn't have it.'

'If you're fired 15 minutes before,' Trump tells Iowa rally, he still wants you to caucus for him.

Remember when RealDonaldTrump couldn't possibly be nominated? Now the question is: Can anyone else? 
Smaller field, higher stakes, tougher jabs -- and more like hand-to-hand combat. Here's my debate take: 
Most skilled debater: tedcruz. But having to spend time arguing you are constitutionally eligible for the job is problematic. 
Most improved debater: realDonaldTrump. Not his natural forum, but shows a definite learning curve. 
It still feels like a two-man race: Trump v. Cruz.

Wait, Sen. Sanders, I keep forgetting: How did Hillary Clinton vote on the Iraq war? 
At GOP debates, George W. Bush rarely mentioned. At the  Barack Obama rarely mentioned. At both, realDonaldTrump often mentioned 
Sanders apologizes to Clinton and agrees to move on. Then manages to slip in mentions of 1) Clinton emails and 2) his Iraq war vote. 
Possibly a prepared statement too good to discard?

For Scott Walker amp; Rick Perry, money problems weren't really the cause. They were the effect. USATODAY 'First Take' 
Well, it is pretty much guesswork. But 'idiotic' seems harsh. : ( 
First Take: Republican outsiders are up, and some insiders are out via USATODAY 
Whom do you believe? 'Sources close to Biden' says he's edging toward a race. But Biden in latest interview doesn't sound like a candidate. 
Actually, that would be 'Carlifiorina,' but close! 
princessjill7 FYI: In new CNN poll, Trump favorable rating 31/unfavorable 59 in sample of all Americans. 
Only 3 GOP candidates CNN poll have positive ratings among all Americans: carlyfiorina realbencarson marcorubio 
Stunning fall: ScottWalker is at less than 1/2 of 1 in new CNN poll. At risk of getting cut from next debate?
