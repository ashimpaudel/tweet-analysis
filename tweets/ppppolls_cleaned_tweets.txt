Our last private poll had Toomey/McGinty starting as a 1 point race 
Polling on LGBT issues is definitely bias 
VM transcriptions of this guy who's been calling us since July trying to reach Trump can verge on performance art 
We get emails 
Go to therapy bruh 
MUST BE THE 'WHITE AGENDA' 
Legislative Republicans in NC have 30/52 favorability rating. Dems lead generic legislative ballot 45/42: 
Roy Cooper's favorability is up to 37/27 from 33/28 a month ago after refusing to defend HB2: 
McCrory's approval comes in at 40/49 this month, making 33 months in a row that he's been under water: 
HB2 is hurting McCrory's remaining crossover support with Ds- down 73/14 with them now, compared to 65/16 month ago: 
For the first time since January we find Pat McCrory behind Roy Cooper, 43/42. Libertarian at 4:

Our new North Carolina poll finds only 36 of voters support HB2, 45 are opposed to it: 
It's hard for me to keep track on a week to week basis of whether we're biased against Hillary or Bernie 
I'm so proud that we are now a verb 
Republicans in North Carolina, 65/18, oppose replacing Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman on the $20 
All the starzzzzzzz 
No one likes Mitch McConnell- 7/43 approval in PA, 10/48 in CT, 8/48 in RI. Unpopularity may be problem for Toomey: 
Strong support for filling Supreme Court vacancy this year- 59/34 in CT, 58/34 in RI, 52/39 in PA: 
59-68 of voters in CT/PA/RI less likely to vote for a candidate who supports privatizing VA health care services: 
In addition to 70-79 of Dems, 55-57 of GOP opposed to privatizing VA health care services in CT/PA/RI: 
64-73 of voters in CT/PA/RI opposed to privatizing VA health care services:

In RI Clinton up 54/40 with actual Democrats but Sanders ahead overall due to 67/28 advantage with independents: 
Clinton trailing with white voters in CT but slightly ahead overall due to 63-24 edge with African Americans: 
Very close Democratic races in Connecticut (Clinton 48-46) and Rhode Island (Sanders 49-45): 
Our new polls in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island are posted: 
Not sure it counts as a surprise but Trump over 50 in all three. Dem race much closer 
We have numbers coming in CT, PA, and RI tomorrow 
Pat McCrory frittered away most of his remaining crossover support in Charlotte to please people like this 
And finally 11 of Marylanders believe in Chessie the Chesapeake Bay Sea Monster, 71 don't, HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND: 
Even though there's strong statewide opposition in MD to Redskins changing their name (32/57), voters in DC suburbs support a change 48/42 
Dems in MD like DC (64/21) and Baltimore (48/30), Republicans dislike them (37/53 and 20/66 respectively): 
Favorabilities of semi ancient to very ancient MD pols- Bob Ehrlich 32/36, Spiro Agnew 11/47, Roger Taney 5/17: 
It's been 150 years but MD voters are still divided on whether they're part of the North (46) or the South (38): 
28 of MD voters would support annexing DC, 44 opposed. GOP (22/59) strongly opposed, Dems (33/37) narrowly so: 
Washington DC has a 55/31 favorability in Maryland, Baltimore's is 37/42, people say they like DC better 55/30: 
People in Baltimore love The Wire- 67/11 favorability in the city, 35/12 statewide. David Simon 47/8 in Baltimore:

88/8 support for expanded background checks in Maryland- 92 of Dems, 85 of indys, 80 of GOP in support:

Even 60 of GOP in MD support the state's higher than national average minimum wage that O'Malley spearheaded: 
82 of voters in Maryland support state's $10 minimum wage, 58 want to increase it to $12: 
Here's the random crap you don't need to know but might find interesting segment of our Maryland poll: 
Thx 
Fav/unfav battery of Pearl Jam, Bruce Springsteen, Harriet Tubman, and Andrew Jackson definitely what we expected to be polling in NC in '16 
We've found it at 69 in NY and MD last 2 weeks, incredibly unpopular throughout Northeast 
BrettLoGiurato No automated calls, even for survey research- makes it impossible for us, much more expensive even for traditional firms 
Indiana hasn't received much polling bc of state laws that are the most hostile to polling of anywhere in country 
Steftyem AtlasHendrixCo EtTuCarl The tweet bothered some people, which was not intended, so we took it down. Pretty straight forward 
Polls appears to be 5 black in 22 black state so Dem numbers likely way off due to that 
AlexDiLalla omjpublicpolicypolling.com 
Taking North Carolina question suggestions for this weekend: 
I wrote this last summer after visiting Harriet Tubman's house in Auburn, NY 
Looking like the voters were Hillary hacks too homes 
Well that's one way to report the results 
Please don't insult political scientists by lumping us in with them 
PowellLatimerNR bepryor Luda brought out actually a pretty demographically representative sample of the Georgia population! 
bepryor I was there irl I bet you didn't know I was that hip 
That's right it's a conspiracy we organized with all the 20 other organizations polling NY 
Martin O'Malley continues to be unpopular in Maryland- 36 see him favorably, 49 unfavorable: 
Hogan up big in early match ups partly because Delaney (29 name rec) and Perez (23) aren't well known: 
Larry Hogan would lead Martin O'Malley 50/36, John Delaney 48/29, Tom Perez 48/24 in hypothetical contests: 
Larry Hogan still very popular- 55/23 approval- 85/6 with Republicans, 42/33 even with Democrats: 
Maryland has one of the country's more popular Senate delegations- Mikulski at 58/26 approval, Cardin at 47/25: 
Or you know it might just be a closed primary state with about a 40 black electorate, did you consider that? 
MD-Sen safe for Dems regardless of nominee. Van Hollen leads Kathy Szeliga 53/25, Edwards leads her 46/26: 
Key in MD-Sen is Van Hollen up by even more with whites (58/16) than Edwards is with black voters (57/19): 
Chris Van Hollen leads Donna Edwards 42-33 in the Maryland Democratic Senate primary, though 25 still undecided: 
Clinton leads Trump 61/28 and Cruz 58/24 in MD. Sanders leads Trump 60/29 and Cruz 62/24: 
Yes it's a very blue state but Cruz (17/69) and Trump (25/70) favorabilities in MD are still pretty remarkable: 
M0Hall0ran stay tuned for later in the week! 
Kasich comes closest in general election matches in Maryland but still trails Clinton 54/33 and Sanders 52/32: 
Clinton leads Sanders in every region except Western Maryland. Also a little closer in Baltimore suburbs: 
Clinton's so dominant in MD she's even up 48/43 with younger voters to go along with her 66/27 lead with seniors: 
Hillary Clinton headed for a big victory in Maryland- leads Sanders 58/33 there. 70/25 with African Americans: 
Trump winning throughout Maryland with exception of DC suburbs. There it's Kasich 46, Cruz 27, Trump 24: 
Only 53 of Kasich, 49 of Cruz voters say they're committed to choice. Could see move toward who does better in NY: 
Not clear Trump would be in trouble in MD even if field did winnow- leads Kasich 53/41, Cruz 54/34 in head to heads: 
Trump most broadly popular Republican in MD with 57/37 fav. Kasich at 48/35, Cruz unpopular even with GOP at 33/50: 
Trump's support in MD isn't what it is in NY, but he's benefiting there from the same evenly divided opposition: 
Our new Maryland poll finds Donald Trump leading with 43 to 29 for John Kasich and 24 for Ted Cruz: 
New Elonpoll also joins us in finding tight race for US Senate in NC- Richard Burr leads Deborah Ross only 37-33, has 29/41 approval 
New elonpoll finds Pat McCrory with a 37/49 approval spread and trailing Roy Cooper 48-42 for reelection 
Barbara Mikulski has a 58/26 approval rating- definitely leaving office as one of the most beloved Senators in the country 
Ted Cruz's favorability in Maryland is 17/69 this is 2 weeks in a row where our public poll has found his unfav at 69 FYI 
Ok 
BullCityVA what's Aaron going to do about that from tucson? 
leestorrow you should have gone to see it before it was the trendy thing to do like I did  
Happy Weekend! 
baseballot jacobfhsmith is a friend of mine! 
Still some time to get in question suggestions for our once in every six years public Maryland poll: 
TurnerWalston pretty sure you have uncbaseballfan2's hair in the background! 
TurnerWalston haha I'm in chapel hill but good if someone is bringing the energy in my absence 
If we test MD-Gov 2018 who are the Dems to look at? 
ActorAaronBooth We're not going to do more than 1 poll a week with our own money, generally 
Sorry we can't do a CT, DE, PA, or RI poll on our own but if someone wants to hire us we'll be happy to! 
MD, like NY last week, is somewhere we don't poll much so now's the time if there's a q you'd like to see there: 
Taking question suggestions for a Maryland poll this weekend:

Only 5 of voters in NY think women who get abortions should be punished, 84 say no. 9/71 even with Republicans:

Here's the rest of our New York poll, a true classic of the 'random crap' genre imo: 
Bout to release the rest of this New York poll and preparing for the angry backlash to the eating pizza with a fork results 
'The Soros poll' 
New WRAL poll has Pat McCrory trailing Roy Cooper by 4 points, bigger than we've ever had him down by in last year: 
This is not a binding vote but where would you most like to see us do a poll among the April 26th states 
Would you like to make a wager? 
oh 
Kasich best polling Republican in NY for general as he is everywhere, but still trails Clinton 50/36, Sanders 54/35: 
Ted Cruz does worst of Republicans in NY. 18/69 favorability, trails Clinton 56/30 and Sanders 59/27 head to head: 
Donald Trump has a 30/65 favorability in his home state of NY, trails Clinton 55/35 and Sanders 58/33 there:

Fyodor32768 People who say they won't vote in a primary are still included in general sample 
The NY GOP finding you won't find anywhere else- 27 approve, 45 disapprove of George Washington being played by a black actor in Hamilton 
Brock_toon Our monthly NC poll will be next weekend 
Very conservative voters in NY: Trump 52, Cruz 35, Kasich 7. Moderates: Trump 51, Kasich 37, Cruz 10: 
NYC: Trump 52, Kasich 37, Cruz 9. Suburbs: Trump 64, Kasich 21, Cruz 11. Upstate: Trump 44, Cruz 27, Kasich 24: 
Another thing to Trump's advantage in NY- 80 of his voters are solidly committed, to 56 for Cruz, 48 for Kasich: 
So basically none of the metrics we usually use to figure out the main threat to Trump produce any separation between Cruz/Kasich in NY 
Second choice in NY- Cruz 24, Kasich 23. Head to heads with Trump- Kasich trails by 34, Cruz trails by 35: 
Cruz really not popular in New York even with GOP voters- 35/50 favorability. Kasich at 41/38, Trump at 65/29:

Among NY Republicans offended by George Washington being played by a black actor in Hamilton, Trump favorability 72/26, Kasich 37/40 
cholbrook2 forget people who find things to complain about at 9-2 in SEC, good grief 
Yeah men all us Dems are terrified of Trump 
nysportsfanatic guessing you pushed for Hamilton or burr before getting to the third option? That would explain 
One of the response options we gave is 'neither, they're both dead' 
parallelcircle we'll have 'em! 
 
BenjySarlin prob have a good Applebee's 
Still some time to get in question suggestions for our first public poll of New York since 2010: 
18/74 favorability for Trump with moderates 
JonCampbellGAN DM me or e-mail tomjpublicpolicypolling.com) by sometime tomorrow with what you think is best and we'll do it! 
JonCampbellGAN What should the response options be for said question? Glad to do it but can't do open ended 
Very rare for us to do an NY poll so if there was ever some random issue you wanted a PPP poll on this is the shot: 
Taking New York question suggestions for this weekend: 
bepryor Uncle Ed was very concerned for your being stuck on the bridge last night 
You are comparing a national poll to a Wisconsin poll, bless your heart 
We get that all the time 
The Kasich voters willing to abandon him to vote for Cruz to stop Trump dynamic is something to keep in mind with polls of later contests 
We had found many Kasich supporters were open to jumping ship, and they preferred Cruz over Trump 51-19 
In WI we found 94 of Sanders voters liked Sanders, 46 disliked Clinton. So a little of both but mostly former 
geoffreyvs cjmab28 we made it clear we thought it was a fluky finding based on a very small subset 
YEP 
Yeah man 
Trump fans have big complex about his media coverage- 76 think he's been treated unfairly: 
Candidate treated worst by media: Trump 33, Clinton 20, Cruz 13, Kasich/Sanders 9: 
Candidate treated best by media: Clinton 47, Trump 22, Sanders 8, Kasich 4, Cruz 3: 
A plurality of voters think all 5 Presidential candidates have been treated fairly by the media: 
I'm flying back from Houston and my soul is dead so didn't write anything re: our media poll but will RT any interesting observations on it! 
As well as our 7th annual poll on TV News trust: 
Here's our new national poll on how voters think the media has treated the Presidential candidates: 
jacobfhsmith Jacob please just worry about your schools basketball game right now 
Clinton was up 54-36, 53-32 our last two national polls 
We also found Ryan would trail Hillary Clinton 44/39, only a shade better than Trump's 48/41 deficit 
Last week we found only 42 of GOP voters would consider Ryan to be acceptable nominee, compared to 58 for Trump 
johnmanuelba i remember when he was on a BA cover haha 
Has almost identical support to Rick Perry as possible independent candidate! 
What  of people booing Obama for intro'ing a video about Texas Western are Trump supporters 
bepryor 'Joel don't do that...ok fine' 
_Choo__Choo_ That's a better looking river right there 
Joey_Powell TurnerWalston not the most glamorous River I've ever spit in but I did it 
Joey_Powell TurnerWalston Houston doesn't have 'rivers' it has 'bayous' but there are plenty to go spit in! 
Have a blessed day 
aaronfitt you're not going to watch from the parking deck? that's the main seating area! 
It's been a week on the Twitter 
Take any poll with a sample size under 5.7 million with a grain of salt y'all 
Well consider the poll debunked 
What a monster 
It's the PPP/Morning Joe alliance conspiracy 
JasontheCTgreek I think it's too small of a subgroup in WI to mean much 
Expect Cruz to win by more healthy margin since he has room to grow and Trump really doesn't 
 
is that language really necessary 
Sure he didn't read it, but our analysis of this poll is about how he'll prob lose by more: 
bless your heart 
OK THANKS FOR LETTING US KNOW 
Hulk Hogan (21/37 favorability) and Gawker (6/38) are both held in little regard by the voters with an opinion: 
36 of Americans stand with Hulk Hogan, 9 stand with Gawker, and 55 including me don't care: 
67/26 support nationally for EPA Clean Power Plan- 87 of Dems, 72 of indys supportive: 
84/10 support nationally for background checks on all gun purchases- 91 of Dems, 81 of indys, 77 of GOP favor: 
72 of voters nationally support increasing minimum wage to at least $10 an hour- 89 of D's, 72 of I's, 53 of Rs: 
Paul Ryan has a 37/44 approval nationally which makes him look like Beyonce compared to McConnell's 16/64: 
Another problem for GOP Senators seeking reelection this year is Mitch McConnell. 16/64 approval, 10/70 with indys: 
Among indys, 47 less likely, 15 more likely to vote for GOP Senate candidate who backs Trump in general: 
By a 23 point margin, voters nationally say they're less likely to vote for GOP Senate candidate who supports Trump: 
Rick Perry gets 20 of the GOP vote as indy candidate- shows the limits of  not that many would bail: 
We tested Rick Perry as an independent candidate for President. He gets 12. Deez Nuts gets 10: 
Paul Ryan would trail Clinton 44/39 and Sanders 45/38 nationally. Only does 1.5 pts better than Trump in h2h's: 
Clinton (45/32) and Sanders (48/31) would each lead Romney by double digits. Not exactly the GOP's savior: 
Mitt Romney's 23/65 favorability rating nationally is worse than Trump's 29/63 standing: 
Dems lead generic Presidential ballot 45/43. Trump does 5 pts worse than generic GOP, Cruz 1 worse, Kasich 6 better: 
Kasich once again the strongest GOP general candidate in our new national poll- leads Clinton 45/41, Sanders 44/41: 
Clinton (48/41 v. Trump, 45/42 v Cruz), Sanders (48/40 v. Trump, 48/41 v. Cruz) both lead the top GOPers nationally: 
Our new national poll finds Mitt Romney would do even worse against Clinton and Sanders than Trump is: 
Wow 
We will try to get by 
tripgabriel Rick Perry gets 12 as independent, Deez Nuts gets 10 
My spell check really ought to just recognize 'Deez' by this point 
In our new national poll Donald Trump's favorability is 29/63. But Ted Cruz's really isn't that much better at 30/58 
Dratch_24 Very small high MOE subsample 
SethDavisHoops yeah it's not a terribly meaningful difference, but first poll we've ever had with Cruz ahead at all on that metric 
Wisconsin voters want the Supreme Court seat filled this year 52/38, including 51/41 with independents: 
Wisconsin another place where damaged brand of Senate GOP hurts the incumbent- Mitch McConnell has 12/46 approval: 
57 of voters in WI say support for VA privatization makes them less likely to vote for Johnson, 29 more likely: 
1 issue hurting Johnson in WI-Sen race is support for VA privatization. Only 24 of voters support it, 68 opposed: 
Russ Feingold leads Ron Johnson 46/39 in Wisconsin Senate race. Johnson is unpopular, with a 35/42 approval spread: 
Unusual finding in WI- Cruz voters (83) more firmly committed than Trump's (81). Trump has always led that metric: 
Trump has a negative favorability with Republicans in WI- 45/48. Kasich at 52/30, Cruz at 50/36: 
Only 63 of Kasich voters are solidly committed to him in WI, compared to 80 of Trump/Cruz's. Could shift to Cruz: 
Cruz leads Trump 49/41 head to head in Wisconsin. Kasich voters would prefer Cruz over Trump 51/19: 
We find close GOP race in WI- Cruz 38, Trump 37, Kasich 17- but also signs Kasich voters could peel to Cruz: 
Keys for Sanders in WI: up 65/28 with voters under 45, 59/37 with 'very liberal,' 56/39 with men: 
Clinton leads Sanders 50-42 with Democrats in WI, but Sanders is up 62-31 w/ independents for overall 6 point lead: 
Our new Wisconsin poll for VoteVets finds Bernie Sanders leading Hillary Clinton 49-43 in the state: 
Always happy to share about dog 
Our real poll on whether a hot dog is a sandwich came out almost same as our Twitter poll. Weird Twitter is America 
Like, the generational divide on if a hot dog is a sandwich far outpaces that on gay marriage and legalizing pot: 
Seniors (45/40) think a hot dog is a sandwich. Young people (10/80) think a hot dog is not a sandwich: 
Only 29 of Americans think a hot dog is a sandwich, 60 think it is not: 
That damn kasik 
You're going to have wait until tomorrow for full  but the generational divide on whether a hot dog is a sandwich is Clinton/Sandersesque 
thx for clearing that up 
An egg named American weighing in in this way is just too perfect 
sonoffire94 Small N 
Among Clinton voters 53 see her as moderate, 36 as liberal. So her supporters are fine with moderate perception: 
45 of Dem voters think Clinton is a moderate, 37 a liberal, 9 a conservative: 
On the Democratic side Hillary Clinton still has solid lead over Bernie Sanders nationally at 54/36: 
Trump continues to have most committed support- 80 will definitely vote for him compared to 66 Cruz, 49 Kasich: 
Among people voting for Trump, 48 see him as conservative, 42 moderate. Being perceived as moderate not all bad: 
44 of GOP voters think Trump is a moderate, 31 a conservative, 17 a liberal: 
Thinks Muslims should be allowed to serve in US Military (Yes/No): Trump voters 42/39, Cruz 41/37, Kasich 75/15: 
Think Obama is a Christian/Muslim: Trump voters 9/62, Cruz voters 12/56, Kasich voters 46/31: 
Think Obama was born in United States (Yes/No): Trump voters 26/52, Cruz voters 32/39, Kasich voters 58/23: 
Trump/Cruz voters are Birthers, think POTUS is Muslim. Kasich voters don't think either thing. Kasich distant 3rd 
Extremism of Trump voters hasn't changed. Only 26 think President Obama was born in US, 62 think he's a Muslim: 
Favorability ratings with GOP voters nationally- Trump 51/40, Cruz 49/39, Kasich 44/41: 
Really remarkable how unpopular Romney is w/ GOP base- 28/62 favorability. Big part of why- at 10/80 w/Trump voters: 
For all the  talk, more Republicans find Trump acceptable as nominee than anyone else in field or out: 
The 'GOP Establishment' has a 28/55 favorability with GOP voters nationally. Romney's favorability is 28/62: 
GOP voters on who would be acceptable nominee- Trump 58, Cruz 53, Kasich 49, Ryan 42, Romney 28: 
GOP voters nationally say they would find Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney to be unacceptable as party nominee: 
Kasich voters would prefer Cruz over Trump 51/23, creating effectively tied race nationally if Kasich got out: 
Our new national poll- Trump 42, Cruz 32, Kasich 22. But Trump would only lead Cruz 46/44 one on one: 
Paul_Kushner it was low energy because I wasn't there 
Thx for your thoughts on everything 
aaronfitt South Carolina should be  tbh 
aaronfitt more beach weekend with your wife less tweeting about games you watch on the computer c:BullCityVA 
Is a hot dog a sandwich? 
Preliminary indications are that America is *SHARPLY DIVIDED* over whether a hot dog is a sandwich 
wccubbison haha this is from 2 weeks ago, that was like 18 months of rot 
wccubbison it's true tho 
Final question on new national poll: Do you consider a hot dog to be a sandwich, or not? 
This would be news to most of my friends but I appreciate it 
Final call for national poll question suggestions: 
I don't know does it 
Baseball loyalties in MO are Cardinals 48, Royals 35 
MaggiePatton94 Is Lent over already? 
PCalith We do a national poll pretty much every month whether there's a Presidential race going on or not 
Special focus of this month's national poll is tv news/the media. And of course always open to fun question ideas: 
Still some to get in question suggestions for our national poll: 
demoncrat haha I see what you did there good one 
If the candidates for President were Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, who would you vote for? 
This is everything y'all 
Apparent Arizona blowout shows how different the game is going to be in closed primary states on the Democratic side 
Pima County (Tucson) early vote in, more big leads for Trump and Clinton: 
Trump and Clinton have huge leads in early vote in Pinal County, Arizona's 3rd largest: 
Clinton up by 24, 47k raw votes in Maricopa County early vote 
Thx 
ALWAYS WRONG ALWAYS 
And of course we're always open to any fun or quirky question suggestions you'd like to see on a national poll: 
It's time for our annual poll on tv news/the media, so particularly interested in question suggestions on that: 
Taking question suggestions for a national poll this week: 
Sorrow money is even better than Soros money 
Don't feel bad JohnKasich we're waiting for that mythical Soros check too 
Anti discrimination ordinances certainly are evil and clinically insane 
Finally we find Duke Basketball has a 40/26 favorability in NC, compared to 53/19 for UNC in the TAR HEEL STATE: 
83/8 support for expanded background checks in NC- 89 of Dems, 80 of indys, 78 of GOP is supportive: 
76 of voters in NC support increasing minimum wage to at least $10 an hour- 89 of Dems, 74 of indys, 62 of GOP: 
Thom Tillis continues to have a very low approval with North Carolina voters- 24 to 38 who disapprove of him: 
NC General Assembly has 18/52 approval. GOP (30/50 fav) more unpopular than Dems (36/40). Dems 46/43 generic ballot: 
Dems (58/17), indys (48/21), GOP (45/38) in NC agree the legislature should not interfere with Charlotte's laws: 
Only 25 of NC voters think General Assembly should override Charlotte's anti-discrimination ordinance: 
Close state level races across the board in NC- Dem candidates lead by 1-3 points for Lt. Gov, AG, Treasurer: 
McCrory continues to be unpopular- 40/49 approval. Plurality of voters (39) continue to have no opinion re: Cooper: 
Pat McCrory starts general at 42 to 40 for Roy Cooper and 6 for Libertarian candidate for Gov in NC: 
15-18 of voters in NC- including 22-25 GOP- would support conservative independent candidate if nominee was Trump: 
Only 73 of NC Republicans support Trump against Clinton, compared to 81-82 for Cruz and Kasich: 
Clinton leads Trump 44/42, Cruz 45/42 in NC. Sanders leads Trump 48/41, Cruz 45/42. Big electability diff w/ Kasich: 
Kasich only POTUS candidate of either party with positive fav in NC- 36/31. Leads Clinton 49/41, Sanders 44/41: 
John Kasich by far strongest general election candidate in NC...leads Clinton by 8 as Trump and Cruz both trail her: 
Another problem for Burr is overall damaged brand of Senate Republicans. McConnell approval in North Carolina 15/51: 
48 less likely to vote for Burr if he supports Trump, only 22 more likely to. A problem for all GOP Senators up: 
By a 26 point margin NC voters say they're less likely to vote for Richard Burr if he supports Donald Trump: 
Richard Burr still not popular- 32/40 approval rating. Deborah Ross unknown to majority (56) of voters in NC: 
Richard Burr starts general up just 40/35 on Deborah Ross in NC-Sen race. Dole started general +5 on Hagan in 2008: 
Our new North Carolina poll really shows how Donald Trump could be a problem for down ballot Republicans: 
TurnerWalston turner please don't do that I don't think it would be very safe 
BullCityVA good Friday date! 
BullCityVA aaronfitt NO FUN 
leestorrow real transit users don't tweet about it every time they use transit FYI 
Me irl 
BullCityVA put it in the Smithsonian 
Consistent with state level polling we've done finding voters mad at GOP Senators in OH/PA/WI/NH/NC/AZ/MO/IA 
BullCityVA I FOUND THE BACK STORY: 
BullCityVA I know but where in SC? I do not recognize that palace. Where did you cross the state line 
BullCityVA where are you? 
A PARADIGM!! 
Fans at UNC game crowding the TV on the concourse to pull for UALR  
We've found McCain has 26/63 approval, quite possibly most unpopular Senator in the country 
mhickey187 Yeah I would think in the next couple weeks 
Still some time to get in question suggestions for our North Carolina general election poll this weekend: 
JGFAN we can poll some stuff on our own without being hired to, but only so much 
When someone pays us to 
We've found 21 of Trump voters think Scalia was murdered (although not specifically by Obama) 
You're right, our poll is completely invalidated because we didn't ask you 
McConnell's approval in key Senate battlegrounds: 13/56 in PA, 14/57 in OH, 14/58 in WI, 14/58 in NH 
Rob Portman has a 35/38 approval, and by a 74/18 spread OH voters want Obama's pick to get real consideration 
Pat Toomey has a 29/40 approval, and by a 67/27 spread PA voters want Obama's pick to get real consideration 
Roy Blunt has a 25/48 approval, and by a 66/24 spread Missouri voters want Obama's pick to get real consideration 
FO_Woolverton both are fine! 
Taking question suggestions for our first North Carolina general election poll this weekend: 
Our poll 3 weeks ago that found Rubio down 20 in FL primary also found him with a 31-55 approval with state overall 
Can't believe this poll was wrong! (on the Senate race anyway): 
Bernie Sanders won on campus voting site at UNC by 1,400 votes, lost in the rest of Orange County to only win it by 1.5 overall 
Deborah Ross winning Dem NC Senate primary by 46, Richard Burr GOP primary by only 37. Could really become a race to watch 
Trump now winning election day vote in NC by 4k votes with almost 60 in to go with early vote win...getting tougher and tougher for Cruz 
Donald Trump has now moved ahead in election day vote in NC to go along w/ his substantial early vote lead- close but looking better for him 
Congratulations pennyrich ! 
Cruz winning election day vote by 5,000 votes so far, cutting into Trump's 23,000 early vote lead 
Shout out to Sittenfeld campaign attacking our integrity when we showed him getting crushed: 
So far in North Carolina early votes, Deborah Ross leading Dem Senate primary by 48 points compared to Richard Burr's 39 pt lead for GOP 
Will be surprised if North Carolina is not called for Clinton the second the polls closed 
jlove1982 gregoryjwolf You can't write in anyone for anything (: 
Yep- Clinton primary voters insisted they wouldn't vote for Obama in the general election which of course they did 
Came across this while packing up to move offices 
Didn't realize we hadn't included the full reports, here they are: 
This is the most amazing write up of a poll I have ever read 
We will try to get through the day after the stinging censure of GOPKICKSASS 
? 
Thx 
77-81 of D primary voters in FL/IL/MO/NC/OH more likely to vote for candidate who wants move to renewable energy: 
66-73 of Dem primary voters in FL/IL/MO/NC/OH less likely to vote for politician who supports VA privatization: 
67-71 of Dem primary voters in FL/IL/MO/NC/OH oppose privatizing VA health care services: 
Clinton's already built up a 68/29 lead among early voters in North Carolina: 
Clinton still well positioned in the Southern states that vote tomorrow- up 57/32 in FL, 56/37 in NC: 
Clinton up 55/37 w/ Dems in OH, 59/37 in IL, 56/39 in MO. But huge crossover support makes Sanders wins possible: 
Sanders benefiting in Midwest from huge support from independents- 53/20 in OH, 69/18 in IL, 62/23 in MO: 
Real chance if Sanders outperforms his polls the way he did in Michigan that he could sweep the Midwest tmrw: 
Clinton leads Sanders just 46/41 in Ohio and 48/45 in Illinois. Sanders leads Clinton 47/46 in Missouri: 
Our new Democratic primary polls, conducted for VoteVets Action Fund, find toss ups in IL, MO, and OH for tomorrow: 
We also polled most of the statewide down ballot office primaries in NC but I'll spare national twitter the details: 
Roy Cooper leads Ken Spaulding 53/17 in NC Dem Gov primary, up by wider 68/22 spread with those who already voted: 
NC GOP Senate primary: Richard Burr 48, Greg Brannon 20, Paul Wright 4, Larry Holmquist 3: 
Deborah Ross' 32 point lead in Dem NC Senate primary actually larger than Richard Burr's 28 point lead on GOP side: 
Deborah Ross at 40 in NC Senate primary, no one else above 8. Ross 50, Rey 17 among those who have already voted: 
Connect NC bond is passing 67/18 among Dem primary voters in NC, just 47/43 with GOP primary voters. 60 overall: 
Rubio has negative favorability in NC at 39/48 with *Republicans* Polling at 7 overall, just 4 with early voters: 
wccubbison You have to wait for it to come out with the other states tomorrow. OR I MIGHT TELL YOU BY DM 
Kasich actually has best favorability in NC now at 60/23, followed by Trump at 56/38, Cruz at 51/35: 
89 of Trump voters in NC solidly committed, 84 of Cruz's. Rubio (68), Kasich (65) voters more likely to jump: 
Trump only leads Cruz 49/43 h2h in NC- if Trump's going to be stopped it's Kasich/Rubio voters going to Cruz: 
Since a month ago in NC Trump is up 15 points, Cruz is up 14 points, Rubio is down 9 points, and Kasich is steady: 
Our full NC poll, which finds Trump 44, Cruz 33, Kasich 11, Rubio 7, is now posted: 
Rubio supporter trash talk game still strong at least 
ForecasterEnten MonadoXx Correct. We were hired only to do the Dem races 
We will have new numbers in the morning on the Democratic race in all 5 states voting Tuesday- very tight races in Illinois, Missouri, Ohio 
Marco Rubio's at only 4 in North Carolina among people who have actually already cast their ballots 
JUST KIDDING on the last tweet. Final NC poll: Trump 44, Cruz 33, Kasich 11, Rubio 7. Full results up later tonight 
Ok Marcio Rubio's at 7 in North Carolina. Just stay tuned for another 30 minutes and we'll tell you where John Kasich is 
Hopefully the poll is floating around the internet in its entirety somewhere so you can find out the results earlier 
bradTmusic 10-11 PM 
We're going to release it an hour later every time someone asks :) 
We've found 55/23 in Ohio that voters there think Rose should be in the Hall of Fame 
Phil Berger has a 15/19 favorability with GOP voters statewide, they will surely be waiting with bated breath 
dcircosta DHJohnson76 alas we have polled this and the people are content: 
You heard it here first, Trump will defeat McConnell in the 2020 KY Senate primary, or something like that 
We found Browns fans wanted the team to dump Johnny by a 72/12 spread 
We found Kasich led Trump 55-40 if it was a head to head in Ohio 
NathanWurtzel this poll was out of the field Wednesday morning when the most recent released polls had Trump up by 20 
Write up on the FL GOP poll we did Monday/Tuesday: 
when does the fighting and name calling start this is boring 
We will have a final poll on the primaries in NC, most likely released Sunday night 
And finally Cedar Point beats Kings Island 47/22 in amusement park loyalty. Don't ever let it be said we don't poll the big questions y'all 
Ohioans don't really think Skyline Chili is all that great- 32 see it favorably, 22 unfavorably: 
Indians fans outnumber Reds 44/32 in OH. Terry Francona has 50/9 approval w/ fan base, Bryan Price at just 22/18: 
As bad as the team has been, Ohioans are loyal to the Browns. Beat out the Bengals in fan loyalty, 42/29: 
72 of Browns fans want the team to dump Johnny Football, only 12 want to keep him: 
Another indignity for the Cleveland Browns- by a 57/23 margin Ohioans think they'd lose if they played the Buckeyes: 
34 of Ds in OH say they'd consider moving to another country if Trump is elected, 23 of GOP says same for Hillary: 
Ohio another good example of how Obamacare really isn't unpopular anymore. 41 support it, 41 opposed. It's a wash: 
66 support in Ohio for the EPA Clean Power Plan, 29 opposed. 88 support from D's, 63 I's, 44 R's: 
83 of Ohioans want background checks on all gun purchases, 11 opposed. 91 of D's, 79 of R's, 78 of I's support: 
69 of Ohioans want minimum wage increased to at least $10 an hour- 89 of Dems, 69 of indys, 47 of GOP: 
Sherrod Brown beats out Rob Portman as Ohio's more popular Senator, with a 43/33 approval: 
Kasich leads Clinton 52/37, Sanders 54/34 in OH as rest of the GOP field trails the Dems- huge homefield advantage: 
Thanks for weighing in! 
Bernie Sanders leads Rubio 42/38, Trump 44/40, and Cruz 44/38 in Ohio- also similar to Obama's '08/12 margins there: 
Hillary Clinton leads Marco Rubio 44/41, both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz 45/40 in OH. Similar to Obama 08/12 margins: 
While Rubio has become very unpopular in FL during his POTUS bid, Kasich has remained strong in OH. 54/36 approval: 
Rob Portman has a 35/38 approval, Ted Strickland has a 35/39 favorability. Shows you how evenly matched they are: 
OH-Sen basically toss up for general- Strickland 41, Portman 40. Portman up 42-30 in very unlikely Sittenfeld match: 
Rob Portman leads Don Eckhart 60-7 in Ohio GOP Senate primary. Portman at 53/24 approval with primary voters: 
Strickland has a 57/21 favorability with Dem primary voters. 63 still have no opinion about Sittenfeld: 
Ted Strickland still looks like strong fav in OH-Dem Senate primary- 50 to 16 P.G. Sittenfeld, 6 Kelli Prather: 
Here's the rest of our Ohio poll, which I'm sure as many as 5 of our followers have been eagerly awaiting: 
Always appreciate the Trump supporters weighing in. And both my parents are Librarians so kinda true 
Some day that Soros check will come in and we'll go live in the Bahamas 
We get emails 
It's true tho 
Trump is tied nationally! With Taylor Swift at 40 on who voters think is more qualified to make Supreme Court pick: 
Trump does at least beat out Mickey Mouse- narrowly at 43/39- for who voters would trust more to pick SC Justice: 
Voters would rather Tom Hanks (47/35) or Peyton Manning (45/35) make new Supreme Court pick than Donald Trump: 
Americans have so little faith in Trump to make Supreme Court nomination they'd rather a celebrity do it: 
Mitch McConnell has a 10/59 approval rating nationally- could be a major weight on GOP Senators this year: 
Even w/ Republicans nationally a 53/37 majority think the Senate should at least give Obama's SC nominee a chance: 
66 of voters think Senate should at least see who President Obama puts forward, only 25 want reflexive rejection: 
Overall 56 of voters nationally want Supreme Court seat filled by nominee of President Obama's this yr, 40 don't: 
61 of independents don't trust Trump to make Supreme Court pick, 58 don't trust Cruz and Rubio to make it: 
Particularly brutal for Rubio- only 41 of REPUBLICANS trust him to make Supreme Court pick, 45 don't trust him to: 
Just 26 of voters nationally trust Marco Rubio to make new Supreme Court pick, 61 of voters don't trust him to: 
Only 31 of voters nationally trust Donald Trump to make new Supreme Court pick, 62 of voters don't trust him to: 
Only 33 of voters nationally trust Ted Cruz to make the new Supreme Court pick, 57 of voters don't trust him to: 
Our new national poll finds voters don't trust the GOP Presidential candidates to nominate a Supreme Court justice: 
politicswthsoul Sunday night, most likely 
Hillary won the Ann Arbor precinct I grew up in 476-372  (it has the professors rather than the students) 
Don't think that 5 we found for Rubio in Ohio yesterday is looking too crazy 
johnmanuelba can you get me tickets Mr. baseball 
THANK YOU FOR THE HEADS UP 
He beat out Drew Brees, Eli Manning, Ben Roethlisberger, and Russell Wilson 
Always fun when you're just reading Sports Illustrated on the bus home and there's your poll 
Smart 
There probably will be a Draft Romney movement in 3912 tbh 
We are indeed very bias 
2016 y'all 
Sanders up 48/39 with 'very liberal' voters in OH, but Clinton up 62/33 with 'somewhat liberal,' 61/30 w/moderates: 
81 of Clinton voters in OH are firmly committed, compared to 67 of Sanders voters. Clinton up 66/34 among those totally decided 
Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders 56/35 in Ohio, 74/14 advantage with black voters is key: 
Yeggo haha I can't really think of any. Jerry Sandusky had a 3 favorability rating even 
Some things are a bridge too far even for Trump voters- KKK has 6/85 approval with them, Mussolini 0/70 fav in Ohio: 
One thing that continues to bode well for Trump is level of supporter commitment- 80 'definitely' for him- 71 Cruz, 58 Kasich, 52 Rubio 
Mitt Romney has 33/50 favorability with Ohio GOP- 11/76 with Trump voters. Not exactly beloved elder statesman: 
Yes- think Kasich would win Ohio if the vote was tomorrow based on overall findings of the poll 
Rubio in distant last in Ohio even when you combine 1st and 2nd choices- Kasich 55, Trump 46, Cruz 28, Rubio 22: 
Kasich has 70/22 favorability in Ohio compared to 48/44 for Trump, 40/45 for Cruz, and 33/51 for Rubio: 
31 of OH voters say they might change minds between now and next week, strategic voting would be good for Kasich: 
Kasich leads Trump 55/40 in Ohio h2h. Wins Rubio voters 75/16, Cruz voters 69/25, undecideds 54/11: 
Our new Ohio poll: Trump 38, Kasich 35, Cruz 15, Rubio 5. Lots of underlying good numbers for Kasich though: 
21 of Trump voters in Ohio think Scalia was murdered 
Another finding from Ohio- if GOP voters had to pick between Trump and Romney, they'd take Trump 52/36 
Yep Marco's falling apart is just a Democratic conspiracy for sure 
Also Benito Mussolini has a 1/75 favorability rating with Ohio GOP, can't remember polling *anyone* who managed 1 but Benito earned it 
Marco Rubio's at 5 in the Ohio poll we'll release later today. 33/51 favorability with GOP voters 
aaronfitt might need new leadership 
DanaHoule Not saying everyone's doing that, just that a fair number are. When Hillary wins KY by 30 will be glad to say we had bad sample 
DanaHoule alexhazanov the poll respondents 
joesonka think people are conflating primary and general on who they voted for 8 years ago 
alexhazanov DanaHoule black sample in KY very small and not statistically meaningful. People are conflating 08 general/primary vote 
Good point, similar dynamic to Oklahoma 
True 
If Cruz really has day it's looking like he might, reminds me of day Santorum won CO/MN/MO big practically out of nowhere, became clear  
Yes it's nice to have a cozy room where the family can watch TV 
 
We've done the Supreme Court poll in 8 states- unpopular incumbents, unpopular McConnell, mandate for filling vacancy, blow back from indys 
Voters in AZ/MO 34 pts less likely to vote GOP for Senate bc of Supreme Court obstruction, 21 pts in NC, 14 in IA: 
Even GOP voters in AZ (56/35), NC (54/38), MO (52/37), IA (50/39) think Senate should give Obama's pick a chance: 
Supermajorities of voters in AZ (69/25), MO (66/24), NC (66/25), IA (66/26) think Senate should at least see who nominee is before deciding 
Key independents in MO (60/38), AZ (59/37), IA (58/38), and NC (55/38) especially want to see Court vacancy filled: 
Majorities of voters in IA (56/40), AZ (56/41), MO (56/41), and NC (55/41) want Supreme Court seat filled this yr: 
McConnell continues to be very unpopular in key Senate states- 11/63 in IA, 16/68 in AZ, 16/69 in MO, 19/65 in NC: 
Approvals in our new round of polls- John McCain 26/63, Roy Blunt 25/48, Richard Burr 28/44, Chuck Grassley 47/44: 
Our new polling on the Supreme Court issue in Arizona, Iowa, Missouri, and North Carolina: 
Thx 
AdamWeinstein haha no, we just waited to launch the poll to see if anything happened in the debate we needed to poll 
Staff emails in 2016 
We had Trump leading a GOP national poll in April 2011 
 H/T BrettLoGiurato 
He calls polling companies too 
Still some time to get in question suggestions for our upcoming Ohio poll: 
daveweigel Sweetwaters 
Numbers among voters who said their minds were completely made up when we polled a couple weeks ago 
And finally that analysis found Clinton leading Sanders 64-36 for the 3/15 North Carolina primary (5 of 5) 
And that same analysis also found Clinton leading Sanders 78-22 for next week's primary in Mississippi (4 of 5) 
That same analysis also found Clinton leading Sanders 60-40 for next Tuesday's primary in Michigan (3 of 5) 
That same analysis found Clinton leading Sanders 77-23 for Saturday's primary in Louisiana (2 of 5) 
The analysis we did Saturday about where the Dem race stood with committed voters held up pretty well tonight except for Oklahoma...(1 of 5) 
Approval ratings with FL Republicans: Rick Scott 62/27 (+35), Marco Rubio 50/38 (+12) 
Our next public poll will be Ohio, taking your question suggestions: 
And finally NFL loyalties in Florida: Dolphins 20, Bucs 15, Packers 9, Patriots 8, Cowboys/Jaguars 7, Giants 4: 
MLB loyalties in Florida- Braves/Rays 13, Marlins 12, Yankees 10, Red Sox 9, Cubs 7, Mets 5, Phillies 4: 
College sports loyalties in Florida- Gators 29, Noles 19, UCF 12, the U 10, USF 5, FIU 3, FAU 1: 
If you think paying people $10 an hour is Socialism, I think you need to bone up on Socialism 
86 of FL voters support background checks on all gun purchases. 89 of Democrats, 84 of both indys and GOP for it: 
69 of FL voters support EPA Clean Power Plan. 86 of Dems, 72 of Independents, 51 of Republicans for it: 
76 of FL voters support increasing minimum wage to at least $10 an hour. 92 of D's, 74 of I's, 62 of R's for it: 
Bill Nelson is Florida's most popular politician, with 40/32 approval. Rick Scott at 38/48, Marco Rubio at 31/55: 
We generally find public opinion pretty evenly divided on Obamacare nationally and in swing states now. Not unpopular like it used to be 
Florida's a great example of how the landscape has shifted on Obamacare- 42 support it, 41 opposed now: 
Bipartisan support for medical marijuana initiative in FL- Dems (75/18), indys (70/22), GOP (53/40) all support it: 
Second time may be the charm on medical marijuana in Florida- 65 of voters support measure this year, 28 opposed: 
Undecided leads both the GOP (47) and Democratic (45) primaries for Senate in Florida: 
Grayson is best known FL-Sen candidate but still only 47 name rec (16 fav, 31 unfav). Rest at 25-31 name rec: 
Alan Grayson trails David Jolly 38/35, leads Carlos Lopez-Cantera 38/35, leads Ron DeSantis 40/34: 
Patrick Murphy leads David Jolly 38/34, Ron DeSantis 41/33, and Carlos Lopez-Cantera 40/31: 
The Senate part of our Florida poll finds Democrats leading 5 of 6 possible matches. Murphy average +7, Grayson +2: 
Cruz had a negative favorability with GOP voters on our most recent FL and SC polls 
Last wk we had BS up 49/42, but HRC up 53/47 w/committed voters. Bernie has lots flirting with, but not choosing him 
David Duke has a 9/77 favorability with Louisiana Republicans, never tested him anywhere else 
These are very similar to what we found last week. Think HRC may outperform based on our analysis from last night 
We will take that under advisement, Mr. 99 vs. Hillary2016 
Is that hashtag catching on? 
Bernie will have to win over a massive percentage of the persuadable voters in the upcoming primaries to keep them competitive 
And finally we found Clinton up 70/30 in North Carolina last week among voters whose minds were totally made up 
And we found Clinton up 60/40 in Michigan last week among voters whose minds were totally made up 
And we found Clinton up 78/22 in Mississippi among voters whose minds were totally made up 
Looking beyond Tuesday- last week we found Clinton up 77/23 in Louisiana among voters whose minds were totally made up 
Point- Clinton's base is much more solidly committed to her than Sanders, and now that momentum has shifted to her that may become important 
In Oklahoma last week we found Clinton up 57/43 among voters whose minds were totally made up 
In Massachusetts last week we found Clinton up 53/47 among voters whose minds were totally made up 
In Virginia last week we found Clinton up 72/28 among voters whose minds were totally made up 
In Georgia last week we found Clinton up 75/25 among voters whose minds were totally made up 
In Tennessee last week we found Clinton up 69/31 among voters whose minds were totally made up 
In Arkansas last week we found Clinton up 67/33 among voters whose minds were totally made up 
In Alabama last week we found Clinton up 76/24 among voters whose minds were totally made up 
In Texas last week we found Clinton up 69/31 among voters whose minds were totally made up 
One thing we've repeatedly found is Clinton voters are more firmly committed to her than Sanders- could help explain over performance in SC 
There's nothing we'd rather be than dank 
Rough numbers for Rubio on the home front 
Thx for writing 
Bot hilarity 
And they're proud of the behavior 
One bad poll for Trump, was told I looked like a 'complete virgin,' should go drink bleach and no one would miss me 
Exposed 
The Rubio check never came so we signed on off with Trump 
QuinnipiacPoll out this morning with Clinton up 59/33 in Florida almost identical to 57/32 lead we found yesterday. South is a blowout 
Yes actually, we have throughly polled the conspiracy theories relating to President Obama 
I'm sure if Ted Cruz loses Texas Tuesday it will be bc of the Zodiac Killer poll question to people in Florida 
Hillary doing better in polls this week from MA/TX/GA/VA than what we found last week. Could have momentum after NV 
And by popular demand 10 of FL voters think Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer, 28 are not sure, and 62 say he isn't: 
One big key for Clinton in Florida is 66/23 advantage over Sanders with seniors who are large swath of electorate: 
Clinton particularly strong with blacks voters in FL- 68/26. But up 54/34 with whites, 54/40 with Hispanics also: 
Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders 57/32 in Florida- another strong state for her in the South: 
3 person field in Florida- Trump 51, Rubio 33, Cruz 11. Trump leads Cruz 62 to 30 head to head: 
Trump leads and has between 39 and 51 in Florida with every ideology, gender, and age group- very consistent: 
36 of GOP voters in FL say they might change minds. Trump has most committed voters- 79 to 62 Cruz, 54 Rubio: 
Cruz has an upside down favorability with Florida REPUBLICANS- 39/48. We found same thing on our final SC poll: 
Trump now has a 64/27 favorability with FL Republicans, better than Rubio's 60/28. Carson most popular at 65/18: 
Rubio trails both Hillary Clinton (45/43) and Bernie Sanders (44/42) in general election matches in Florida: 
Plurality of voters in Florida (44) say it's time for Rubio to drop out, 40 say he should keep on going: 
Rubio now has 31/55 approval rating as Senator in FL, down from 41/44 in September. Campaign has hurt image at home: 
Rubio beats Trump h2h w/Cruz (56/25), Kasich (47/32), Carson (64/21) voters in FL- only enough to cut deficit to 14: 
The most important finding from our new Florida poll- Trump 52, Rubio 38...HEAD TO HEAD: 
Our Florida poll that wrapped up tonight (pre-debate): Trump 45, Rubio 25, Cruz 10, Kasich 8, Carson 5: 
Ok Twitter after that debate you earned this: 
that's a new one 
mpayneone DKElections both 
We're going to release our new Florida poll when the debate ends tonight. And yes, it will include *that* question 
OH poll from QuinnipiacPoll and WI poll from MULawPoll have reinforced what we found about voters wanting the Supreme Court vacancy filled 
Don't think Quinnipiac is crazy 
Republicans said yes, Democrats said no 
I mean we wouldn't lie to you 
U r welcome 
We may just have to do a free standing poll at some point in the future on the important issues being raised 
No but we polled about whether Olive Garden is a high quality authentic ethnic restaurant 
We already did is a burrito a sandwich how many questions of this genre do you people have 
We are finding many Floridians can not rule out the possibility, although few are convinced of guilt 
I guess we brought this onto ourselves 
galendruke just seeing what other full groups of people Trump voters want to ban along with Muslims 
Relevant we're somehow missing, I'm sure 
ok weird twitter you can have the very last question on the poll 
Fox News national polling reinforces what we've been finding in key Senate battlegrounds on the Supreme Court issue 
Bottom line- we've now found in 4 states with GOP Senators that voted for Obama twice that Supreme Court issue is very bad for Republicans 
57 of indys in NH, 56 in WI less likely to vote for GOP Senators because of obstructionism on Supreme Court issue: 
51 say they're less likely to vote for Kelly Ayotte this fall because of Supreme Court stance, 26 more likely: 
53 say they're less likely to vote for Ron Johnson this fall because of Supreme Court stance, 26 more likely: 
Even 66 of GOP in NH/WI think Senate should see who Obama nominates instead of dismissing confirmation out of hand: 
78 of voters in NH, 76 in WI think Senate should at least see who Obama nominates before deciding path forward: 
Particularly emphatic support from independents in WI (67/30), NH (60/33) for filling Supreme Court seat this year: 
Strong support for filling the Supreme Court vacancy this year- 62/35 in Wisconsin, 59/36 in New Hampshire: 
NH, WI make two more states where Mitch McConnell's unpopularity is a real threat to his incumbents- 14/58 approval: 
Ron Johnson (33/50 approval) and Kelly Ayotte (42/48) in pretty rough shape for reelection to begin with: 
Our new polls in NH and WI find that Kelly Ayotte and Ron Johnson are hurting themselves w/ the Supreme Court issue: 
Still some time to get in question suggestions for our upcoming Florida poll: 
This seems like kind of a disproportionate reaction to a 3 week old poll about Football 
 
Nearly identical to 43-37 spread we found last week in that race 
Taking question suggestions for a Florida poll: 
The harder they attack the more scared they are has been my experience 
McConnell could be big drag on Senate R's this year- Pelosi in 2010 was nowhere near this level 
New elonpoll finds Roy Cooper leading Pat McCrory 42-40. Bless your heart RRRpolls 
Sure missed that in the Constitution 
Bottom line- swing state voters want Scalia replacement this yr and GOP putting itself at risk with obstructionism: 
Indys less likely to vote for Portman (59/15), Toomey (55/24) if they don't even give Obama SCOTUS nominee a chance: 
By 27 point margin voters in OH/PA say they're less likely to vote for Portman/Toomey if they don't even consider SCOTUS nominee 
Even GOPers in PA (67/27),OH (63/32) don't think Senate should just reject any potential SCOTUS nominee out of hand: 
Almost all voters in PA (76/20), OH (74/18) think Senate should at least see who Obama nominates before deciding: 
Independent voters in both OH (70/24), PA (60/37) particularly strong in support of filling SCOTUS seat this year: 
Strong majorities of voters in both OH (58/35), PA (57/40) think vacant seat on SCOTUS should be filled this year: 
Mitch McConnell may be weight on Senate Republicans seeking reelection this year- 13/56 approval in PA, 14/57 in OH: 
Pat Toomey has a 29/40 approval rating in Pennsylvania, Rob Portman's is 30/39 in Ohio: 
Our new polls find Toomey and Portman with miserable approval ratings- and that Supreme Court issue might hurt them: 
leestorrow connecting back from LAX where I also trailed you haha 
leestorrow I was there this morning too, we are trailing each other across the country 
Now this is the falsest statement of the campaign 
SydDontLie DiamondHeels haha we've been doing a lot of Tar-ing the last 15 minutes! 
Trump supporters always charming 
Smart 
Haha we really are waiting for that alleged Rubio money to come in 
Marco Rubio is consistently the strongest Republican in general election matches in our polling 
Feel pretty good about our Trump 35, Rubio/Cruz 18, Kasich 10, Bush/Carson 7 poll that was 1st released post debate 
What we found Trump voters in South Carolina think 
Clinton at 63-74 of black voters in upcoming states, Sanders at 12-23: 
Key for Clinton in upcoming primaries- up 40 to 62 points w/ black voters in the states that have large black pops: 
Polling we did earlier this week found Hillary Clinton leading by double digits in 10 of the next 13 primaries: 
This dynamic is why we find Hillary leading 11 of the next 13 primaries 
And people really thought we and our peers should try to poll this shit? 
We are very multi dimensional here at PPP what can I say 
aaronfitt pull hard for the Chants Fittsy 
newschannelnine yes just polled the Dems 
aaronfitt root hard for the Monarchs Fittsy  
Pat McCrory's under water 42/46 approval in tonight's nonpartisan NCCapTonight poll almost identical to 40/47 we found this week 
Our good friends at HarperPolling join us in interestingly finding Cruz under water on his favorability in SC: 
Fits with our data finding that Trump voters in SC still think the Confederate flag should be flying, 70/20 
86/8 support in NC for background checks on all gun purchases- 92 of Dems, 85 of indys, 78 of Republicans: 
68/24 support for Clean Power Plan in NC- 86 of Democrats, 63 of indys, 52 of Republicans favor it: 
Bipartisan support in NC for at least $10 minimum wage- 85 of Dems, 66 of indys, 53 of Republicans: 
69 of NC voters support increase in minimum wage to at least $10 an hour, only 17 think current wage is enough: 
Thom Tillis has a 24 approval rating, 35 disapproval. Hard to imagine another Senator with approval that low: 
Deborah Ross continues to be favorite for NC Dem Senate nomination- 22 to 10 for Chris Rey and Kevin Griffin: 
Richard Burr not at any risk in primary- 56 to 13 for Greg Brannon, 4 and 3 for other challengers: 
Richard Burr's approval is 29, disapproval 40. Why race could get interesting depending on how year plays out: 
NC Senate race a little tighter this month- Richard Burr leads challengers by 6-7 pts. 43-37 v. Deborah Ross: 
Pat McCrory has 69 in GOP primary for Governor, challengers are at 5 and 4: 
Roy Cooper leads Ken Spaulding 55/12 in NC D primary for Governor- still no sign this will ever become competitive: 
Pat McCrory continues to be unpopular- 40/47 approval. Roy Cooper has 32/22 favorability, 46 with no opinion: 
North Carolina Governor's race has its requisite closeness- Pat McCrory leads Roy Cooper 43/41 this month: 
Democrats (65/6), independents (56/12), and GOPers (54/11) in North Carolina all want nonpartisan redistricting: 
Our new poll finds North Carolina voters support nonpartisan redistricting by a 59/9 spread: 
holdenWU Chancellor if you were really watching a Florida-Georgia game I admire your appetite for college basketball 
We wrote yesterday about why Rubio could end up a strong second in SC if strategic voting happens 
jinxpolitics it did 
It's a good thing the success of your clients doesn't depend on having a consultant who can write in English 
It's very glamorous to run a polling company (6 of 6) 
So I don't know if he was just really lonely or the long weather discussion was his form of revenge for calling and polling him (5 of ?) 
But then he apologized for being so nasty and engaged me in a 15 minute discussion about the weather in Arkansas (4 of ?) 
So I called him back today to tell him it was someone else that kept calling him. He said he was about to report us to the FBI (3 of ?) 
So we immediately put him on our Do Not Call List. But then he called back Tuesday and Wednesday with similarly nasty vm's (2 of ?) 
So this man called from Arkansas and left a very profane voicemail Monday night telling us not to call him ever again (1 of ?) 
Sanders far outruns his overall numbers in these states on Wall Street and increasing wealth for average Americans: 
Voters in 5/12 states trust Sanders more to crack down on Wall Street, in 4/12 to raise wealth of average Americans: 
Clinton leads Sanders in 11 of 12 states on Commander in Chief fitness, race relations, immigration, women's issues: 
Clinton lead with blacks: 67/22 AL, 74/12 AR, 70/14 GA, 72/15 LA, 71/19 MI, 66/19 MS, 74/15 TN, 63/23 TX, 74/16 VA: 
Clinton gets anywhere from 63-74 of black vote in key Super Tuesday states, Sanders gets 12-23: 
The key for Clinton- up 40-62 points with black voters in the 9 early March states that have big black populations: 
Closest primary state for early March, based on our polling this week, is Oklahoma. Clinton 46, Sanders 44 there: 
Sanders leads 86-10 (!!!) in Vermont and 49-42 in Massachusetts: 
Clinton also leads 60-26 in Mississippi, 58-32 in Tennessee, 57-34 in Texas, and 56-34 in Virginia: 
Clinton leads 59-31 in Alabama, 57-32 in Arkansas, 60-26 in Georgia, 60/29 in Louisiana, and 50-40 in Michigan: 
Our new polling for American Family Voices finds Clinton leading Sanders in 10 of 12 early March primaries: 
People who vote for Bloomberg would support Sanders 52/16 over Trump if those were their only two options 
NC already jumping off Panthers bandwagon post Super Bowl loss- 54 identify as fans now, down from 60 in December: 
Mike Krzyzewski (50/10) and Roy Williams (49/12) have almost identical favs that lap any politician in the state: 
DanaHoule It's in there for the Democrats and the general election. Just don't bother for GOP 
If this is our only contribution to the field we will be able to sleep well at night 
One things NC voters agree on across party lines is rooting for Tar Heels over Duke- 42/30 with Dems, 40/30 w/ GOP: 
Our annual UNC/Duke poll finds NC rooting for the Tar Heels, 39/29. Has been the case all 9 yeas we've done poll: 
Bloomberg gets 16 in NC against Sanders/Trump. His voters are 52/16 for Sanders in Sanders/Trump h2h. Takes Trump from -2 to +6 in 3 way 
Bloomberg gets 14-16 as indy in NC, Deez Nuts gets 9-10, so Bloomberg 5 pts better than replacement level indy: 
Sanders does better in NC general election matches- leads Trump 44/42, Bush 43/42, ties Cruz, trails Rubio 45/41: 
Rubio leads Clinton by 9 in the general in NC, 49/40. Others only lead by 1-3- Trump 44/43, Cruz 46/43, Bush 44/42: 
Clinton leads Sanders 52-35 in NC. 43-42 with whites, 64-24 with blacks. Very similar splits to South Carolina: 
We appreciate your feedback 
1 big thing Trump has going for him in NC- 68 of his voters are firmly committed, no more than 51 for anyone else: 
In NC Rubio's favorability is 58/26 to 47/36 for Cruz, 46/43 Trump. Makes him candidate most able to consolidate: 
Why Rubio beats Trump head to head- wins Cruz (73/25), Kasich (64/17), Bush (61/24), Carson (48/38) voters handily: 
Trump could struggle in 1 on 1 race in NC though- trails Rubio 49/43, leads Cruz only 43/42: 
Getting field down to 3/4 doesn't stop Trump in NC- Trump 37, Rubio/Cruz 26 / Trump 34, Cruz 24, Rubio 19, Bush 11: 
Still a very fluid race in states that don't vote for a month- 47 of NC Republicans say they might change mind: 
Trump actually down 9 from our NC poll last month. Kasich up 9, Rubio up 5, Cruz up 3, Bush/Carson steady: 
Our new North Carolina poll finds Trump 29, Cruz 19, Rubio 16, Kasich 11, Carson 9, Bush 7: 
THANKS FOR FILLING US IN 
Always love to hear our followers got polled by us! 
Gender/age splits in SC- Sanders up 45/43 w/ men, 44/42 w/ younger voters. Clinton 64/25 w/ women, 70/20 w/ seniors: 
Open primary helps Sanders catch up in SC- Clinton up 60/29 with Dems, but Sanders up 55/27 with independents: 
Democratic race in SC is tied with white voters at 46, but Clinton up 63/23 with blacks for overall 55/34 lead: 
If Rubio can make SC voters see choice Saturday as between him and Trump, chance for a strong second based on poll: 
Trump leads Rubio 46/45 h2h in SC. Bush (73/10), Cruz (67/26), Carson (54/34), Kaisch (50/29) voters would go Rubio: 
Context for all the other views of Trump's SC voters- 32 think Japanese internment was a good policy, 33 don't: 
40/36 support among Trump voters for shutting down all Mosques in US. Only 44 think Islam should be legal at all: 
Trump voters in SC support his Muslim ban 80/9. 31 also support ban on gays entering the country: 
70 of Trump voters think Confederate flag should still be flying, 20 don't. Wish South had won Civil War, 38/24: 
Trump supporters in SC have a wide swath of racially and religiously intolerant views: 
And among voters who don't like GWB in SC Trump 57, Kasich 12, Cruz/Rubio 11: 
GWB popular in SC- 64/25 fav. But Trump is winning among voters who like him! Trump 26, Cruz 22, Rubio 20, Jeb 10: 
Showing limits of popularity, Carson most popular in SC at 68/23. Rubio 58/32, Kasich 52/29, Trump 50/43: 
One surprise- Ted Cruz has worst favorability in SC at 42/48. Bush also under water at 41/43: 
If Kasich/Bush/Carson/Undecideds in SC had to pick 1 of top 3 37 go to Rubio, 19 Trump, 13 Cruz: 
If voters in SC had to pick just among the top 3 Rubio gets 2nd by himself- Trump 40, Rubio 28, Cruz 22: 
Pretty fluid race in SC- 29 say they could still change mind. Rubio looks to be most likely beneficiary if they do: 
Trump is leading and between 29-40 with every ideology, religion, party, gender, and age group we track in SC: 
Our new SC Dem poll finds Clinton 55, Sanders 34: 
Our new SC GOP poll finds Trump 35, Cruz/Rubio 18, Kasich 10, Bush/Carson 7: 
Our full South Carolina poll is up: 
Thanks for the heads up 
Full SC poll up shortly- one amazing finding- by a 38/24 spread Trump voters wish the South won the Civil War  
byelin trump and Clinton are winning  
Lol 
George W. Bush had a 74/21 favorability with GOP voters nationally the last time we polled it, higher than anyone in this field 
Lindsey Graham had a 38/49 approval with GOP primary voters in SC by the end of his campaign- not too risky for Trump to go after him 
Thanks to everyone who came out! 
mhickey187 yep! 
Tuesday or Wednesday. Waiting to field until after the debates 
reapersaff if someone commissions one from us! 
FOmyronpitts Will be after the debates! 
Still some time to get in question suggestions for our SC and NC polls launching on Sunday, after the debates: 
So after 39 months Jeb ended up where he started in NH, Christie lost 14 pts, Rubio lost 3 pts, and rest of field wasn't on radar in 11-12 
Our very first NH poll back in November 2012 had Christie 21, Rubio 14, Condi (!) 13, Jeb 11, Ryan 10, Huckabee 8, Santorum 5, Palin/Paul 4 
musicjew Yeah we're starting Sunday so that it will be after the debate 
Taking question suggestions for upcoming South Carolina and North Carolina polls: 
TVMoJoe If it really said Public Policy Polling it's someone else using our name 
ActorAaronBooth we will probably only poll NV if someone commissions us to 
We'll launch an SC poll Sunday after this week's debates 
The findings may reflect Nickelback's inherent blandness! 
Deez Nuts is the new benchmark against which we measure all other indy candidates. He gets 10, Bloomberg 11 
We ask the questions the people ask us to ask 
Here's the rest of our national poll from last week: 
Brady won our polls for both most popular NFL QB *and* least popular NFL QB 
Dr. Carson apparently since we found Panthers 40 Broncos 40! 
If you think asking people what they think about Cam Newton is the same as asking white people if they're racist... 
Huh? (Rand Paul dropped out, time for his supporters to move on) 
Serena 88/4 with African Americans, 46/15 with whites. Very similar breakdown to Cam 
Nonwhite NFL fans think the Redskins should change their name, 47/35. White fans opposed to a change 15/77: 
Only 25 of NFL fans think the Redskins should change their name, 64 think they shouldn't: 
Roger Goodell has just a 19 favorability with NFL fans- 40 see him unfavorably, 40 no opinion: 
Favorite NFL team closely bunched up- Packers 15, Panthers 13, Patriots 11, Cowboys 10, Steelers 9, Broncos 8: 
Americans don't think Cowboys are America's team- only 27 think they deserve that designation, 64 say they don't: 
For the first time ever the Cowboys don't win our most hated NFL team poll! The Patriots edge them out 23/20: 
Only 16 of NFL fans think Johnny Manziel will ever amount to anything, 45 say he won't, 39 not sure: 
Only 21 of NFL fans think Joe Flacco is a elite Quarterback. 35 think he isn't, 44 are not sure: 
There's a massive generation divide on TD dances. Seniors disapprove of them 32/43. Younger voters like them 67/21: 
NFL fans approve of touchdown dances 57/27. Pretty big party difference- Democrats 70/17, Republicans 48/31: 
Among Republicans nationally Peyton Manning has a 79/12 favorability, Cam Newton's is 48/24: 
Cam Newton has a 46/23 favorability with whites and an 81/1 favorability with non-whites nationally: 
Peyton Manning (77/11 favorability) and Cam Newton (57/16) are both pretty popular nationally: 
29 say Tom Brady is their most hated NFL QB, non-NFL QB Tebow finishes 2nd at 10, no one else in double digits: 
Despite not having played in 3 years Tebow beat out Eli, Russell Wilson, Drew Brees, and Big Ben on our QB poll: 
We included Tim Tebow in our QB poll because why not and he finished 5th most popular at 7, tied for 2nd among GOP: 
My spell check wasn't happy! 
Favorite NFL Quarterback: Tom Brady 23, Peyton Manning 16, Aaron Rodgers 13, Cam Newton 11: 
We polled on the Quarterback people like the most and the one they hate most...and Tom Brady won both categories: 
Division on who people are rooting for, but pretty clear who people think will *win*- Panthers 56, Broncos 32: 
A big generational divide in SB rooting too- seniors for the Broncos 55/28, voters under 45 for the Panthers 46/31: 
Big racial divide in Super Bowl rooting- white people for Broncos 46/34, nonwhite people for Panthers 53/26: 
Our annual poll on the Super Bowl finds a nation divided- 40 for the Panthers, 40 for the Broncos on Sunday: 
You missed that we are working with ACORN on it too 
Believe me we are not following you 
lol pt. 2 
lol 
so charming 
dylanlscott I'm impressed. Will try to remember to do it next national poll 
dylanlscott I think this story probably has not permeated Middle American so you'd get 75 no opinion, 7 favorable, 18 unfavorable 
People often conflate our work with that of National Review 
Yes I do remember the NM GOP attacking our 2012 polls nonstop and I know Senator Heather Wilson appreciates it 
Supporters of all non Trump candidates dislike Trump 
I think we're going to be waiting even longer for that check than the one from Soros 
Tomorrow we will have our much more fun football poll! 
Clinton has 79/9 fav with black voters nationally, Sanders' is 27/23. Part of his struggle there is being unknown: 
The key for Clinton's national lead- she's up 82/8 with black voters. Other groups trending closer, not that one: 
On the Democratic side Clinton leads Sanders 53/32 nationally. Getting closer though- 56/28, 59/26 previous 2 polls: 
Even though Rand dropped out in middle of field period, had same support as Jeb Bush on this poll. Jeb! fav 37/47: 
One positive for Trump- 71 of his supporters say they're solidly committed to 52 for Cruz and 44 for Rubio: 
Still a very fluid GOP race nationally- 50 of voters say they could change their minds on who they support: 
We'll get right on that 
One positive metric for Cruz nationally- 41 say he's 1st or 2nd choice to 36 for Rubio, Trump 3rd at 32 on that: 
Cruz actually pretty steady nationally after IA W- was at 18 with 59/27 fav in December, at 21 with 58/28 fav now: 
As candidates in 4th-11th drop out their supporters say they would go Rubio 42, Trump/Cruz 22 if they had to pick: 
In 4 person field- Rubio 32, Trump 31, Cruz 23, Bush 8. 3 person field- Rubio 34, Trump 33, Cruz 25: 
Things bode well for Rubio as the field grows smaller- leads Trump 52/40, Cruz 46/40 in head to heads: 
Rubio has the real momentum nationally- up 8 points and his favorability has gone from 49/34 up to 64/21: 
Big reason why Trump is falling- down to 3rd with 'very conservative' voters. Cruz 34, Rubio 22, Trump 19 with them: 
Trump has dropped 9 points from our last national poll. Also his favorability has gone from 58/34 down to 48/41: 
CaseyClarkjr TeamFlacco that's coming tomorrow! 
Rick Santorum had literally 0 supporters on our final national poll including him so if you reallocate them...lol: 
Our new national GOP poll- Trump 25, Cruz/Rubio 21, Carson 11, Bush/Kasich/Paul 5, Christie/Fiorina 3, Gilmore 1: 
haha 
Yep 
We will have our full new poll looking at the national picture on both sides in the 10 AM hour 
The sort of personal attacks pollsters who have numbers that aren't as good for Trump get subjected to... 
Being used in Donald Trump's monologues is the true measure of pollster quality 
66 of Trump voters nationally think the President is a Muslim, so speaking to the base here 
Certainly nothing disrespectful about insulting the appearance of random people on Twitter, no 
udekel haha don't think we've ever gotten abuse from a Kasich supporters 
haha wow 
Smart take 
Val Demings big early favorite in FL-10 Democratic primary 
If only Trump supporters spent as much time organizing as digging up 10 year old pics of me on the internet... 
Actually it's Gilmore 
There has been so much laughter in the office today 
His supporters have really learned how to speak his language! 
trwilson99 I don't think we'll be polling any more caucuses unless we're privately sponsored to- extremely expensive 
JasonHusser For us we finally no longer have to split GOP horse race into 2 questions due to gt;9 candidates! 
Nah we have Soros 
Yes our Twitter following reaches so broadly through America so as to affect how people answer our polls 
Our new polling on Right to Work in West Virginia 
The Trump people used to like pollsters  
This is my favorite insult of us ever I think 
Not no coin toss state indeed 
Shaking in our boots 
Unsurprising given lack of internal polling that Trump World is unfamiliar with partials 
Still waiting for that check 
Started a national poll tonight that we'll release Thursday but already clear- Trump's standing significantly diminished 
Don't think Selzer really deserves criticism. Clearly there were big shifts in the landscape in the closing stretch 
ActorAaronBooth totally fair. You're a nicer person than me! 
ActorAaronBooth yeah in my book there's no personal protection for sending abusive e-mails to strangers... 
Pretty consistent with what we found about O'Malley voters statewide 
O'Malley finished with 53/18 fav in IA. Trump 50/44, Bush 38/48, Paul 37/46, Christie 36/51 by comparison. Clinton, Sanders just too popular 
Certainly can't claim to have predicted tonight's outcome, but polls do need to be read beyond the toplines 
In October we found only 15 of voters nationally think Iowa should get to vote first: 
Smart take 
Of course we'd love to hear your political question ideas for our national poll too, beyond the football ones: 
We're going to poll America on whether Joe Flacco is an elite QB. What else should we ask about on our NFL poll: 
Our analysis from last week about why strategic voting could lead to some surprises tonight 
Rubio's path- we found if those supporting also rans shifted to 1 of top 3, 35 would go to him, 25 Cruz, 17 Trump 
At 3 in Civitas 
We find Cruz leads Trump 47/40 head to head, so getting voters to see it as a 2 man race is his path 
We found something very similar yesterday- 88 of Clinton, 74 of Sanders supporters firmly committed 
CahnEmily EvanMcSan I think Evan's right that the vast majority are perfectly nice/well behaved, but that's a really interesting thought! 
Received a barrage of middle of the night nasty voicemails on my cell after a poll they didn't like in November 
Yes your clients Senator Linda McMahon and Governor Ken Cuccinelli did so well after attacking our polls 
By popular demand the full 18 point questionnaire/manifest on our Iowa poll: 
We'll truly prove our nonbias next week when we surely come out with a poll showing America wants the Broncos to beat the Panthers by 20 pts 
Also time for our annual NFL poll as part of next week's national poll, so looking for football poll question ideas: 
Taking question suggestions for a national poll we'll start Tuesday to gauge the new landscape post Iowa: 
Bernie supporter sends 18 point manifesto/questionnaire on new IA poll, closes with I know your poll is bogus anyway 
North Carolina/Presidential Elections Preview event from us earlier this week: 
LoganDobson nataliemjb Taniel We've found the same thing 2 polls in a row totaling over 100 IA O'Malley supporters. Also found same in NH 
Democrats in IA really like their candidates more than the Republicans- looking at all 15 on both sides Sanders most popular, Clinton 3rd 
A poll 3 days before the election in November, an 8 point lead is pretty solid. 3 days before the IA caucus, modest 
Martin O'Malley has 53/18 favorability with Iowa Dems- better than Trump, Bush, Christie, Kasich, Paul have w/ GOP: 
Sanders 76/14 favorability makes him most broadly popular candidate among voters in either party in Iowa: 
Sanders path to an upset in Iowa is definitely huge turnout from independents Monday night, given 39 pt lead w/them: 
Big party divide in IA- Clinton up 53/36 w/Dems but Sanders up 62/23 w/ independents planning to show up and switch: 
Clinton leads 56/39 in IA among voters with minds totally made up, Sanders ahead 55/31 with those who could shift: 
88 of Clinton voters in IA say they're firmly committed to her, compared to 74 of Sanders' to him: 
O'Malley voters in IA say 57/27 Sanders is 2nd choice over Clinton, so that could help Sanders make up some ground: 
Our new Iowa Democratic poll finds Hillary Clinton with 48 to 40 for Bernie Sanders, and 7 for Martin O'Malley: 
traviscrayton I prefer the list of names you keep on your phone 
Volvi_E 
English please 
Rand Paul supporter 
Trump up 30/24 with Republicans, 34/16 with indys in IA. Counting on the latter to show up, change registration: 
Trump and Cruz are tied with Evangelicals in Iowa at 29, but Trump is up 32/14 with non-Evangelicals: 
Both also rans in IA but Jeb Bush's net favorability is up 17 pts in last few weeks there, Chris Christie's down 27: 
The highest favs in Iowa go to Ben Carson (72/20), Mike Huckabee (60/28). Guess being liked isn't everything: 
Sarah Palin only has a 45/40 favorability with Iowa Republicans, not sure how much credit she gets for Trump's rise: 
Cruz leads Trump 38/24 w/ 'very conservative' in IA,but Trump up 34/17 w/ 'somewhat conservative,' 32/6 w/moderates: 
Supporters of candidates in single digits prefer Cruz to Trump 50/21- his path is for folks to see it as 2 man race: 
Cruz still leads Trump 47/40 h2h in Iowa. Supporters of all 10 other candidates would take Cruz before Trump: 
If a lot of people supporting single digit candidates move to their next choice in IA, could let Rubio get 20-25: 
Among IA GOP supporting the 9 also ran candidates, if they had to pick 1 of top 3: Rubio 35, Cruz 25, Trump 17: 
kylesmithwick CarlyFiorina Corrected 
Only candidate with supporters as committed as Trump in IA is Rand Paul- should get him 5th, maybe sneak into 4th: 
Trump's lead over Cruz in Iowa goes up to 36/24 among voters who say they've completely made up their minds: 
80 of Trump voters in Iowa say they're firmly committed to him, compared to 71 of Cruz's and 65 of Rubio's: 
Still a lot of votes on the table in Iowa- 31 of likely caucus goers say they could change their minds by Monday: 
Big Cruz fav drop comes as Trump pushes birther issue- only 32 of IA GOP think someone born outside US should be allowed to be POTUS 
zephyrericlogan Very similar numbers both days of field 
Big decline in Cruz's favorability rating in Iowa over the last few weeks- from 69/18 down to 56/35: 
ThePlumLineGS tomorrow 
Since our last Iowa poll 2.5 weeks ago, Trump's up 3, Cruz is down 3, and no one else has really moved: 
Our new IA poll- Trump 31, Cruz 23, Rubio 14, Carson 9, Bush/Huckabee/Paul 4, Christie/Kasich 2, GIlmore/Santorum 1: 
There were few people I enjoyed doing radio interviews w/ more than Buddy Cianci- no matter the topic we always ended up on HIS numbers haha 
We will have a new Iowa Republican poll tomorrow afternoon and Democratic numbers Friday morning 
geoff_green traviscrayton Oates4Council astuebe chtransit UNC walk in front of Community Center Park 
mayerhan We'll have one this week 
Woooooooohoooooooo!!!!! Let's do it one more time  
??? 
Also on our NC poll we found Bloomberg's net fav(-18 at 15/33) almost as bad as Clinton's and Trump's (both -19 at 37/56 and 36/55) 
Bloomberg got 10 against Clinton/Trump on our NC poll this week. Of course Deez Nuts got 10 and Bug the Cat 7 
ActorAaronBooth what was the context of this observation? (He has hated us for years) 
Thx 
Re: Dems in North Carolina like Cam Newton better, Republicans like Luke Kuechly better 
73 of North Carolinians want minimum wage increased to at least $10 an hour- 88 of Dems, 58 of Republicans: 
82/10 support for expanded background checks in North Carolina- 86 of Dems, 79 of Republicans in support: 
One year into Senate term Thom Tillis remains extremely unpopular- 22 approval, 41 disapproval: 
Democrats say Cam Newton is their favorite Panthers player 45/19, while GOP says Luke Kuechly is their fav 34/27: 
Cam Newton (56/14 favorability) and Luke Kuechly (50/7) are both broadly popular statewide figures in NC: 
Going into NFC championship, 58 of North Carolinians identify as Panthers fans. It was 34 in December 2014: 
Burr leads Greg Brannon 55-10 in GOP primary, to 6 for Paul Wright and 5 for Larry Holmquist. No real threat: 
Same old story with Richard Burr- approval mediocre at 32/35, but leads Dem opponents by 7-12 points: 
Roy Copper continues to have huge lead over Ken Spaulding in Dem primary- 55/10 overall, 51/11 with black voters: 
Pat McCrory not at any risk in primary- gets 68 to 6 for Charles Moss, 4 for Robert Brawley: 
Pat McCrory starts 2016 with 35/48 approval spread. Cooper has 29/25 favorability, 46 no opinion: 
Our first NC poll of 2016 finds Roy Cooper leading Pat McCrory 43/40: 
In NC this week we found that Bloomberg would get 10 as an independent. And that Deez Nuts would too 
dntrpltt coming tomorrow 
Level of support NC would give possible indy candidates for President- Bloomberg 10, Nuts 10, Webb 7, Bug 7 
Sanders trails GOP field in NC as well- down 5 to Cruz, 4 to Carson/Rubio, 2 to Trump, 1 to Bush: 
GOP leads general election matches in NC. Rubio strongest w/ 5 pt lead over Clinton. Carson/Cruz +3, Bush/Trump +2: 
We tested 4 independents in NC. Michael Bloomberg and Deez Nuts each get 10. Jim Webb and Bug the Cat each get 7: 
In North Carolina, 78 of Clinton voters say they're firmly committed to her compared to 50 of Sanders': 
The key to Clinton's big lead over Sanders in NC- she's ahead 77/12 with African Americans: 
South still looking very good for Hillary Clinton- 59 to 26 Bernie Sanders, 5 Martin O'Malley in NC: 
Trump leads Cruz only 30/27 w/ 'very conservative' in NC. But 42/15 w/ 'somewhat conservative' and 43-2 w/moderates: 
Only 49 of NC GOP aware Cruz was born outside US, and it does hurt him, so no wonder Trump keeps pushing it: 
Among 53 of NC GOP that says someone born outside US shouldn't be allowed to be President, Trump leads Cruz 52-4: 
Cruz birther issue in NC- 53 say someone born outside US shouldn't be allowed to be President, only 28 ok with it: 
Cruz next in line in NC if Trump falters- 18 2nd choice to 12 Rubio, 11 Trump. Also 2nd choice of Trump voters: 
Trump up big even if field winnows by NC- Trump 43, Cruz 27, Rubio 18; Trump 41, Cruz 24, Rubio 15, Bush 13: 
65 of Trump voters in NC are firmly committed to him compared to 54 for Rubio, 50 for Cruz, 33 for Bush/Carson: 
Unusual finding- Trump also has highest favorability with NC Republicans at 62/30. Huckabee next best at 58/21: 
The candidates whose support is on the decline in NC- Carson, from 14 to 8, Rubio, from 14 to 11: 
The only candidates whose support in NC is on the upswing: Trump who's gained 5 points, Huckabee who's gained 4: 
NC was first place Trump ever led, with 16 in July. Has increased support EVERY MONTH since to now lead with 38: 
Our new North Carolina poll: Trump 38, Cruz 16, Rubio 11, Carson 8, Huckabee/Bush 6, Christie 4, Fiorina/Paul 3: 
dd3ab7e02b3d4eb next week 
Bush, Huckabee tied on our new North Carolina poll coming tomorrow 
Yeppppp 
Guess who has their highest level of support ever in our monthly North Carolina poll coming out tomorrow... 
Dwight Evans leads Chaka Fattah 37-21 in our latest PA-2 Democratic primary poll: 
DBreban we released the whole Iowa poll last Tuesday, general election stuff is in the PDF 
When he get above 5 
Let's do it two more times!!!  
A plurality of Trump voters nationally think Japanese internment was good: 
We have some HOT new numbers 
DKElections was not asked 
Ohio Dem primary voters support a redistricting plan to make Congressional districts more competitive, 60-16: 
Democratic primary voters in Ohio support gradually raising the minimum wage to $15/hr 69-21: 
Our poll for OHDems has Ted Strickland leading the Dem Senate primary with 61, Sittenfeld and Prather each at 10: 
Our new poll for OHDems finds Hillary Clinton with a 53-37 lead over Bernie Sanders among Democratic primary voters 
Second choice of O'Malley voters in Iowa: Sanders 43, Clinton 20 
On our last South Carolina GOP poll including Lindsey Graham he was at 2 and had a 39/48 favorability rating 
Voters nationally support the EPA Clean Power Plan 64/28- Rubio's hostility not a general election winner 
GOP voters support the Muslim ban 54/25, Trump voters support it 82/5. This issue isn't going to hurt him in primary 
New York's favorability nationally is 40/29, Texas' is 40/31 
88/10 support among Christie voters nationally for expanded background checks 
85/6 support among Rubio voters nationally for expanded background checks 
77/17 support among Trump voters nationally for expanded background checks 
79/14 support for expanded background checks among GOP primary voters nationally, including 92/5 with Bush voters (small sample, granted) 
In 2012 when Newt was fighting it, we found the media had a 14/77 favorability with South Carolina Republicans 
I don't even know what this is in reference to 
MABlumenfeld It's the top 3 among voters currently supporting an also ran candidate (so not current Trump/Cruz/Rubio voters) 
And if they chose just between 1 of the top 2 candidates, Cruz 60 Trump 24. Trump has to really hope for minimal strategic voting (4/4) 
If they picked 1 of the top 3 candidates- Cruz 38, Rubio 31, Trump 15 (3/4) 
Rubio favorability with them is 53/25, Cruz 52/29, Trump 31/48 (2/4) 
Here are some findings about voters in Iowa supporting candidates who currently have single digit support, and who thus might shift...(1/4) 
Goes along with our finding in IA that 78 of Clinton's supporters are firmly committed, compared to 64 of Sanders' 
cholbrook2 happy birthday and thanks for being so good to TysonLusk hope the concert is awesome! 
bretbarden Did you join the lottery to win 1.5B dollars, because then you wouldn't need those cheap theater tickets bruh 
Jesus and Trump 
Taking question suggestions for our North Carolina poll this weekend: 
Our last national poll found 57 of Republicans think minimum wage should be increased to at least 10 dollars an hr 
You exposed us 
You're right, we have been terrified by Rand's debate performances 
Yes he is much more higher 
iamtheman331 they're in the PDF we released today 
Clinton up 52/36 with women, 64/26 with seniors in Iowa. Sanders up 46/39 with men, 55/33 with younger voters: 
Silver lining for Clinton in IA- 78 of her respondents are committed to her, compared to 64 of Sanders' to him: 
O'Malley's presence in race is helping Clinton. 2nd choice of his voters is Sanders- 43/20 in IA, 47/13 in NH: 
IA tightening is about Sanders getting more popular- fav has gone from 65/23 to 79/13 in last month. Clinton steady: 
Clinton 46, Sanders 40, O'Malley 8 on Dem side in IA. Sanders +6, Clinton -6 since last month: 
77 of IA GOP voters say they don't care that Fiorina rooted for Iowa in Rose Bowl, 15 less likely to vote for her: 
Jeb Bush (26/53) and John Kasich (26/39) both have favorabilities mired in the mid-20s in Iowa: 
Cruz leads Trump 54/37 head to head in Iowa. Supporters of all 10 other candidates would prefer Cruz to Trump: 
If supporters of also ran candidates in IA move to one of the top 3 Trump's in trouble. Cruz 38, Trump 32, Rubio 22: 
73 of Trump voters in IA firmly committed to him, 58 for Cruz and Paul, 57 for Carson, everyone else below 50: 
Trump leads Cruz 37/26 among IA GOP offended by bilingual phone menus, Trump drops to 3rd among those not offended: 
Telling crosstab- Trump leads Cruz 38/23 in IA among Obama birthers, Cruz leads Trump 29/22 with non-birthers: 
If Trump voters ever get cold feet Cruz will romp in Iowa- second choice of 39 of his supporters to 11 Carson: 
ActorAaronBooth the 49 is just among people who picked a candidate, i.e. undecideds eliminated 
Good news for Cruz in IA- 69/18 fav laps the field. Only others in 60s are nonfactors Huckabee (61), Carson (60): 
There are still more Republicans in Iowa (34) who think Cruz was born in the US than think Obama (28) was: 
24 of Cruz voters in Iowa say someone born outside US shouldn't be allowed to be President: 
Why Trump keeps harping on Cruz birther thing- still only 46 of IA Republicans realize that he was born outside US: 
Among 47 of IA GOP who think someone born outside US should not be allowed to be President, Trump leads Cruz 40/14: 
The birther issue could hurt Cruz. Only 32 in Iowa think someone born outside US should be allowed to be President: 
Our new IA poll- Trump 28, Cruz 26, Rubio 13, Carson 8, Bush 6, Christie/Fiorina/Huckabee/Kasich/Paul 3, Santorum 2: 
Here's a great measure of Obama Derangement Syndrome- 69 of Iowa Republicans think he faked his tears in his gun announcement last week 
We'll have a bunch of new polling on the Cruz birther issue tomorrow 
kanyewest thanks Kanye you too 
Does Trump have multiple Twitter accounts 
52 is the new 47 
dbernstein Agree 
Always appreciate the constructive criticism 
Sanders 54, Trump 34 head to head in the battleground state of New Hampshire: 
Which sports team Granite State voters care about the most- 42 Patriots, 24 Red Sox, 9 Bruins, 6 Celtics: 
No need to pander on college football championship in NH- 63 don't care, 20 Clemson, 17 Alabama cc: CarlyFiorina 
70 of voters in NH want the minimum wage increased to at least $10 an hour- 95 of D's, 68 of I's, 48 of R's: 
Big shift we keep finding on Obamacare- Dems (85) more unified in support than GOP (70) is in opposition: 
NH another state that shows how much the politics on Obamacare have changed- 47 support it now, 40 opposed: 
94-96 of D's, 80-82 of I's, 72-73 of R's in NH support gun proposals that have received most attention lately: 
83/11 support in NH for both expanded background checks and barring people on terrorist watch list from buying guns: 
NH headed for close Gov race too- 42/42 on generic ballot, Sununu leads Dems by 2-4 pts thanks to superior name rec: 
Hassan has a 48/39 approval to 41/43 for Ayotte...despite close race Hassan has always had better approval: 
Kelly Ayotte gets 44 to 42 for Maggie Hassan in NH Senate race. Stable race, always within 2 points in last year: 
Sanders in NH leads Bush 50/38, Rubio 51/37, Carson 53/34, Trump/Cruz both by 20 at 54/34 and 55/35 respectively: 
Bernie is remarkably popular with overall electorate in NH- 55/35 favorability when everyone else is under water: 
Rubio comes closest to Clinton in NH- 45/42. Bush trails her 46/40, Cruz 48/40, Carson 50/39, Trump worst at 50/36: 
Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both lead the GOP field in NH, but Sanders does an average 9 points better: 
We found this week that 20 of NH Republicans think Obama will take EVERYONE's guns away by end of year 
jlove1982 time for that space to revert to its former life as a BW3's 
Still some time to get in Iowa question suggestions for this weekend: 
Damn tolerance 
Taking Iowa question suggestions for this weekend: 
68 of Clinton voters in NH say they're firmly committed to her to 62 of Sanders voters who say same for him: 
TVMoJoe Clinton was up 44/42 
In NH Clinton up 51/38 w/ women, Sanders up 50/42 w/ men. Clinton up 54/36 w/ seniors, Sanders up 46/45 w/ the rest: 
Huge party divide in Dem primary in NH- Clinton leads 55/36 among actual Dems, Sanders up 59/29 with unenrolleds: 
Still a very close Democratic race in New Hampshire- Clinton 47, Sanders 44, O'Malley 3: 
GOP voters who ARE offended by bilingual phone menus- Trump 36, Cruz 13, Christie 12, Rubio 11, Kasich 8, Bush 6: 
GOP voters NOT offended by bilingual phone menus- Rubio/Trump 19, Bush 14, Kasich 13, Christie 11, Cruz 6: 
Whether you are offended or not by bilingual phone menus is a great divider of candidate support in the GOP race: 
20 of GOP voters in NH think Obama will take away EVERYONE's guns during last year in office, 64 don't think that: 
Cruz voters in NH (50/24) say they strongly support the Oregon protesters, other candidates' voters oppose them: 
Just imagine a year or even 6 months ago an NH poll coming out on 1-6-16 where Trump at 29 would be ho hum, Jeb at 10 would be momentum 
27 of GOP voters in NH say they support the Oregon protesters, 39 say they oppose them, 34 aren't sure: 
Cruz is well positioned in NH if Trump ever falters- second choice of 37 of Trump voters, no one else over 10: 
Bottom's dropping out on Ben Carson in NH- fallen from 9 to 4 in last month. Once lofty fav down to 48/34: 
Other candidates rising in NH besides Jeb! are Rubio (+4 from 11 to 15), Kasich (+3 from 8 to 11): 
Candidate with most momentum in NH is...Jeb! Support has doubled from 5 to 10, fav up from 38/45 to 44/42: 
Trump actually trails Rubio 52/40, Cruz 46/39 h2h in NH. But establishment split gives him 14 pt lead full field: 
Rubio/Kasich/Christie/Bush all in double digits really helping Trump in NH- may take more drop outs to stop him: 
68 of Trump NH voters say they're firmly committed to him. 63 Cruz, 58 Bush, 46 Rubio, 40 Christie, 34 Kasich: 
Trump's been very steady in our NH polling over the last 3 months- 28 mid-October, 27 early December, 29 now: 
Our NH poll- Trump 29, Rubio 15, Christie/Kasich 11, Bush/Cruz 10, Carson/Fiorina 4, Paul 3, Huckabee/Santorum 1: 
bihrno probably will not do a monthly poll during that cycle in NC 
Among Trump voters in New Hampshire 32 say they support the Oregon protesters, 33 say they oppose them 
Only 4 of New Hampshire Republicans say they'd be more likely to vote for a candidate who openly rooted for the Patriots in the playoffs 
In August we found among Republicans nationally that 40 thought Ted Cruz was born in the United States, 29 thought President Obama was 
Maybe we'll have to poll Iowa this weekend on whether they think Obama is a King or wishes he was 
Same soundtrack as Raleigh rally we went to last month for sociological purposes, guess that's his play list 
It would suck if your alma mater was up 21-0 in the first quarter of the Rose Bowl and you had to be disappointed about it 
Ooooooookkkkkkkkk 
Dear Carly, If you need help with gross NFL pandering it's 19 Packers, 13 Chiefs, 12 Vikings w/ IA GOP Love, PPP 
Taking question suggestions for our first public poll of 2016, in New Hampshire: 
George Pataki's supporter on our last national poll said their second choice was...Mike Huckabee 
As long as he got the number of letters right 
WillowWatchesTV NH next week 
demogeddon_jay haven't polled that one but sure we'll get a chance as SC primary nears! 
We have found there are more than 3x as many Panthers as Falcons fans in South Carolina 
raphaelptw lol no 
Ok 
Sometimes people don't like it when you wish them a happy Kwanzaa 
Our holidays poll found a Republicans have a negative opinion of Kwanzaa, 27/33. 49/13 with Dems 
The only proper response 
johnmanuelba I'm quite confident you get the baseball equivalent of this 
Here's the rest of the email 
Hoo boy 
We will just have to try hard to overcome the censure of Hillary4DogCatcher1 
Top memory of last time Christmas Eve was a Thursday was getting just shredded by establishment GOP about this:  
VerbDC omjpublicpolicypolling.com 
Polarization in 2015 America extends to Christmas desserts 
freemanhuey1 it's real 
BullCityVA hope it don't got the rabies 
Rudolph and Trump poll high for the same reasons 
I guess they're in suspense until Friday morning 
Thus concludes our public polling for 2015. PPP wishes you a Merry Christmas, Happy belated Hannukah, Wonderful Festivus, and Joyful Kwanzaa 
Right after Obama got reelected 44 thought Santa was a Democrat, now it's down to 28: 
People have been asking for these numbers among full electorate- here they are 
Americans are increasingly less likely to think Santa identifies with either major political party 
Polling at 46 and with 15 undecided, Rudolph should be able to get to that magic 50 mark and avoid an expensive, unpredictable runoff 
PSA 
Rudolph 46, Dasher 9, Prancer 6, Comet/Cupid/Blitzen 5, Vixen 4, Donner 3 in the reindeer primary: 
42 of Americans claim no booze in their egg nog. 22 rum, 16 bourbon, 7 brandy among the rest: 
76 of Americans think they're on Santa's nice list, only 7 on the naughty list. Guess we're all above average: 
Opening Presents Christmas Morning 62, Opening Presents Christmas Eve 23: 
Real Christmas Trees 52, Artificial Christmas Trees 39. Dems (53/40), GOP (51/39) in agreement on that one as well: 
Multi Colored Lights 58, White Colored Lights 34. Dems (60/33), GOP (59/34) agree on that one: 
Americans aren't buying the Grinch's rehabilitation at the end- he has an 18/60 favorability rating: 
American has spoken and only 13 of voters consider Die Hard to be a Christmas movie, 62 say it is not: 
Seniors (58/33) and Republicans (50/46) think fruitcake is good, young voters (27/64), Dems (39/53) say no thanks: 
Fruitcake has an overall negative favorability rating at 38/52. Big party and generational divide on it though: 
Festivus has 24/17 favorability. Positive with Dems at 25/15, negative with GOP at 13/25: 
Kwanzaa has 37/21 overall favorability. 49/13 with Dems but seen negatively by GOP (27/33): 
Americans pretty broadly have positive opinions of Christmas (88/6), Hanukkah (64/8). Kwanzaa/Festivus not as much: 
Most trusted to counter the War on Christmas- Trump 29, Carson 16, Clinton 15, Cruz 14, Bush 9, Rubio/Sanders 6: 
You can add protecting us from the War on Christmas to list of issues Donald Trump is the most trusted candidate on: 
Republicans believe 56/26 that there really is a War on Christmas, Democrats say 26/55 that there is not: 
The share of Americans believing the War on Christmas is a real thing has declined from 47 in 2012 to 37 now: 
Here's our final public poll of the year, our annual Christmas poll: 
National poll numbers- The Grinch 18/60, Mitch McConnell 15/62 
And IVR was a lot more accurate on marriage referendums 
RCP Clinton +6 over Trump, PPP Clinton +3 over Trump, there we did it for you 
SNienow This article: 
Hoosier114 I think they just know she's not Trump 
Have had people asking for Islamophobia questions we've been testing among the full electorate- they're in here: 
Merkel, Hitler, all the same apparently 
Americans think Angela Merkel deserved Time Person of the Year over Trump 42/29. Trump does win 46/23 with GOP tho: 
Partisan divide on Serena/American Pharoah an extension of our finding earlier this year that Serena fav is 70/8 with Dems, 39/20 with GOP 
Yes Kentucky is representative of the country as a whole 
Democrats think Serena deserved SI honor over American Pharoah 57/18, GOP much more closely divided at 40/27: 
Americans are rooting for MSU_Football to win the national title- 26 to 15 Clemson, 13 Alabama, 10 Oklahoma: 
Big change on Obamacare- Dems (71) are more united in favor of it now than the GOP (64) is in opposition: 
Affordable Care Act really ceasing to be political liability for Dems- 41 support it, 39 opposed now nationally: 
57 of GOP voters support increasing minimum wage to $10/hour. Candidates out of touch w/ base on this, gun issues: 
72 of voters nationally support increasing minimum wage to at least $10/hour, just 15 think current level is fine: 
85 of voters nationally support background checks on all gun purchases- 91 of D's, 82 of I's, 80 of R's: 
81 of voters nationally support barring those on terror watch list from buying guns- 85 of D's, 80 of R's: 
Generic Congressional ballot is tied at 43 nationally, reflecting how closely divided the country is right now: 
Mitch McConnell so unpopular with GOP base nationally- 16/62 approval- he's actually a tick higher with Dems at 17: 
Finally a conspiracy theory just about no one believes y'all- only 7 say Ryan beard means he's converting to Islam: 
Paul Ryan has 38/39 approval nationally, while Mitch McConnell at 15/62. 38/39 very good for Congressional leader: 
Thx for letting us know 
Trump gets 23 third party against Clinton/Cruz, takes Cruz from trailing Clinton by just 3 to 16 at 42/26: 
Trump gets 24 against Clinton/Rubio, takes Rubio from +1 to trailing Clinton by 14 at 41/27: 
Have you ever clicked a link: 
GOP really needs to keep Trump happy. Polls at 23-24 running 3rd party, gives Clinton 14-16 lead over Cruz/Rubio: 
Jeb! polls worst of GOP against Clinton nationally, trailing 44/39. Has been weakest GOPer in our last 4 polls: 
Clinton leads Ted Cruz and Donald Trump both 46/43 nationally- not a gimme for Dems even with them as nominee: 
Marco Rubio is only Republican who leads Clinton nationally, 44/43. Ben Carson also ties her at 45: 
We're finding a very close general election nationally at this point- Hillary leads top 5 GOPers by avg of 1.8 pts: 
Here are the full results of our new national poll, first reported by BrettLoGiurato for businessinsider 
Can you imagine spending 4 days of your life being angry about a silly polling question 
We tested Mark Meadows as a primary challenger to Burr earlier this year to get a baseline- Burr led 62/9. Doubt Brannon does much better 
We are unambiguously biased toward the Panthers 
14-0 doesn't care whether you won 35-7 or 38-35  
Did Disney pay him to mention Star Wars too 
So charming 
Yes by rule you generally would not be able to find a poll until it was released 
Hope no one thought homophobia was over! 
What'd they have on Aladdin 
Wonder if that has anything to do with Republicans having 14 candidates vs. Democrats having 4 
Clinton leads all Dem demographics but closest with younger voters (50/35), whites (51/33), 'very liberal' (55/36): 
Clinton's biggest leads over Sanders are with seniors (68/21) and African Americans (67/17): 
Since our November national poll Clinton down 3 points, Sanders and O'Malley each up 2 points. Not a ton of change: 
Democratic field nationally pretty stable- Clinton 56, Sanders 28, O'Malley 9: 
Context on other Trump voters beliefs: 41 think Japanese internment was good, 41 want to bomb Agrabah: 
Cruz (59/21) Bush (67/11) Rubio (77/10) voters all at least think Islam should be legal. Trump voters (33/42) don't: 
28 of GOP voters support shutting down mosques in US, 47 opposed. Trump voters (45/28 support it but on their own: 
Our poll questions are very crowd sourced. We read what you tweet at us and really appreciate the suggestions 
Cruz (40/41) and Rubio (44/45) voters narrowly divided on Muslim database, Bush voters (36/49) are against it: 
GOP voters overall narrowly support Muslim database 46/37, but Trump voters support it 66/15: 
Cruz supporters (57/25) join Trump's in supporting Muslim ban, Rubio's (39/40) divided, Bush's (21/37) oppose: 
54 of GOP primary voters support Trump's Muslim ban, only 25 opposed. His supporters favor it 82/5: 
Chris Christie fav nationally is 49/30, after it was 28/54 in August. Shows the strugglers can still turn it around: 
Bush continues to have just toxic numbers on the right- 20/64 fav with 'very conservative,' only 3 support him: 
GOP candidates with negative fav ratings nationally- Graham (22/50), Bush (34/49), Paul (34/44), Kasich (26/40): 
The GOP candidate w/ the best favorability rating nationally is actually...Mike Huckabee at 63/19. Still at 4 tho: 
Ben Carson's moment has passed- dropped from 19 to 6 in our national polling in just a month, 2nd to 5th place: 
Marco Rubio's treading water- 13 last month, 13 this month. Favorability has dropped from 55/25 to 49/34: 
Cruz most frequent 2nd choice of GOP voters overall (14 to 10 Carson/Trump) and of Trump voters (25, 13 Carson) 
Only 2 segments of GOP electorate Trump doesn't lead with- Tea Party (Cruz up 41/32), 'very conservative' (38/32): 
Trump up w/ Evangelicals (35), non-Evangelicals (33), women/men (both 34), younger voters (38), seniors (32): 
Trump leads with GOP voters concerned about both conservatism (36) and electability (34) nationally: 
Trump's gone from 26 to 34 nationally over last month, biggest gainer. Favorability also up from 51/37 to 58/34: 
Rest of GOP field nationally- Christie 5, Fiorina/Huckabee 4, Kasich/Paul 2, Graham/Santorum 1, Gilmore/Pataki lt;1: 
Donald Trump has his biggest lead in our national polling yet- Trump 34, Cruz 18, Rubio 13, Bush 7, Carson 6: 
Our full new national poll on the primaries for President is up: 
This tweet gives you a pretty good idea of why we're over the criticism we get 
NY Times story from 90s on asking members of Congress about fake foreign policy issues: 
That's actually not what I'm doing right now FYI 
ilovaussiesheps AmandaMarcotte The idea definitely came from y'all 
politicalmath davescruggs robertmclaws 
Silly polls about Aladdin should be something to brighten your Friday, not get really mad about :) 
Lindsey Graham (50 unfavorable) has managed to pass Jeb Bush (49 unfavorable) for most unpopular candidate with GOP voters nationally 
Ben Carson's dropped from 19 to 6 in last month...but has same 61 fav. GOP voters still like him, just don't see him as POTUS material 
Marco Rubio's national favorability dropped from 55/25 last month to 49/34 this month on our new GOP poll 
Cruz at 38, Trump at 32 with 'very conservative' voters on our new national GOP poll- no one else gets more than 8 
We asked the Agrabah question to Dem primary voters too. They oppose bombing 'it' 36/19, while GOP supports bombing 'it' 30/13 
Here are the results of our GOP poll. Agrabah is Q38: 
Trump is at 45 with Republicans who want to bomb Aladdin and only 22 with ones who don't want to bomb Aladdin 
30 of Republicans want to bomb a country from a Disney movie and it's PPP's fault 
30 of Republican primary voters nationally say they support bombing Agrabah. Agrabah is the country from Aladdin.  
Ben Carson's all the way down to 6 in our national poll coming out later today. If he wasn't already done he is now 
The only poll I can find where we ever asked Putin's favorability it was 7/78 overall, 8/81 with GOP. Few people that hated in US 
If his opponents play it right think Trump's Putin embrace has much much more potential to hurt him than support for Muslim ban 
Putin is so unpopular in US that voters say they like Congress better 49/28. Dog Poop 47 Congress 40 for comparison 
So the candidates know who to awkwardly pander to, NFL loyalties in IA- Packers 18, Bears 12, Vikings 11, Chiefs 10: 
Iowa led IA State 43/23 in fan loyalty in May, 45/23 now. Not nearly as much bandwagonism in college as pro sports: 
In May Kirk Ferentz had a 46/30 approval with Iowa fans. Now it's up to 78/4: 
No hard feelings- Iowans pulling for Spartans in college football playoff- MSU 39, Oklahoma 14, Tide 8, Clemson 5: 
Steve King beats Stephen King 48/23 with GOP in IA, but Stephen beats Steve 75/9 with Dems, 49/22 with indys: 
Iowans weigh in on who they like more and it's a blow out: StephenKing 50, SteveKingIA 26: 
Iowa evenly divided on the Affordable Care Act- 42/42- just not liability for Dems that it used to be in key states: 
Over 75 of GOP voters in Iowa support terror watch list gun ban, expanded background checks. Big disconnect with Presidential candidates 
Iowans overwhelmingly support terror watch list gun ban (84/9), background checks on all gun purchases (83/10): 
We continue to find Terry Branstad with his worst approval numbers of the second time around- 37/48 this month: 
Chuck Grassley easily Iowa's most popular politician- 53/33 approval. Leads Dem opponents each by 25 points: 
In IA Sanders leads Fiorina 45/39, Bush 44/40, Trump 46/43, Cruz 44/43, and Carson 43/42. Trails Rubio 44/42: 
Bernie Sanders leads 5 of 6 GOPers in general election matches in Iowa, does average of 2 pts better than Clinton: 
These Iowa numbers looking at Trump third party really show how deadly that could be to GOP hopes next year: 
Donald Trump would get 20 3rd party against Clinton/Cruz in IA, taking Cruz from +3 to trailing Clinton 41/33: 
Donald Trump would get 23 3rd party against Clinton/Rubio in IA, taking Rubio from +7 to trailing Clinton 39/33: 
Actually GOP respondents have been forgetting him for last 6 months, so he doesn't get included in general matches 
Weakest general election GOPer in IA is Jeb Bush, who trails Clinton 46/41. Fiorina down 45/42, Trump down 45/43: 
Strongest general election Republican in IA is Marco Rubio, who leads Clinton 48/41. Ted Cruz also leads her 47/44: 
Our Iowa poll finds Hillary Clinton leading 3 Republicans, trailing 2 of them, and tying the other we tested: 
Have had a lot of people explaining to us why Japanese internment was good the last few days 
Reminds me of our poll finding blame for Obama on Katrina 
In Football 
ilovaussiesheps Going to do this using the name of the country from Aladdin 
Especially interested in fun question suggestions for our Christmas/holidays poll: 
Still some time to get in question suggestions for our national poll this weekend: 
Trump led Bush 56/35 head to head on our Iowa poll today 
JonesAngell I'm sitting here with a 4 yo showing me Gio's return on his dad's phone who just keeps telling me how funny the man yelling is 
HIGHLY RESPECTED 
2015: when POTUS candidates directly link to polls about how their supporters think Japanese internment was good 
What would be some good, fun questions for our annual Christmas/Holidays poll? 
Taking questions suggestions for a national poll this week: 
DanteAtkins We've found Cruz/Rubio head to heads a lot closer elsewhere 
This is in Iowa 
jlove1982 it is! 
My favorite finding from our Iowa poll- Stephen King the Author 50, Steve King the Congressman 26 
PhilNista When there is a funding source it's noted, otherwise we did just it on our own 
Sanders leads Clinton 47/40 with younger voters in Iowa, but Clinton leads him 64/20 with seniors: 
Clinton leads Sanders in Iowa by 15 pts with men, 19 pts with liberals, 21 pts with women, 22 pts with moderates: 
Democratic side in Iowa- Clinton 52, Sanders 34, O'Malley 7: 
Huckabee actually 2nd most broadly popular GOPer in IA, with 64/21 fav. Just not translating to nomination support: 
Kasich in Iowa- 41 still don't even know who he is. 22/37 fav with those who do: 
Rubio really in a holding pattern in IA. 4th with 60/20 fav last poll, 3rd with 59/22 fav this poll: 
Bush has highest negatives of any Republican in Iowa- 35/47 fav. It's 24/61 with 'very conservative' 
If Trump ever does fall apart, Cruz is the 2nd choice of 36 of his voters in Iowa to 14 for Carson: 
Combining 1st and 2nd choice in Iowa- Cruz 44, Trump 39, Rubio 26, Carson 22: 
Cruz has room to grow in IA. Highest favorability at 68/20, most frequent second choice- 19 to 12 Carson/Rubio: 
Cruz leads Trump 33/26 in IA w/ voters most concerned about conservatism, Trump leads Cruz 31/20 on electability: 
Cruz leads Trump 37/25 with 'very conservative' voters in IA. But Trump leads him 42/8 with moderates: 
So here's the kicker to all that stuff about what Trump voters think. He dominates the field with moderates in IA: 
Overall 29 of Iowa R's think Japanese internment was good, 39 that it wasn't. Only Trump's supporters think that: 
Trump voters in Iowa think, 48/21, that Japanese internment during World War II was a good thing: 
Overall 27 of Iowa GOP supports shutting down mosques, 45 opposed. Only Trump's supporters are for that: 
45 of Trump voters in Iowa want to shut down the mosques in the United States, just 23 opposed:

IA Rs overall think 43/29 Arab celebrations of 9/11 happened. Carson/Cruz voters think it did, Rubio/Bush it didn't: 
65 of Trump voters in Iowa think thousands of Arabs in NJ celebrated 9/11, only 11 think it didn't happen: 
Overall 54 of R voters in IA support Muslim ban, 28 opposed. Cruz/Carson voters support it, Rubio/Bush's against: 
78 of Trump voters in Iowa support his Muslim ban, only 13 opposed to it: 
Carson's the big dropper since our last Iowa poll in early November, down 11 pts. Huckabee down 3, Fiorina down 2: 
Since our last Iowa poll six weeks ago Cruz is up 11 points, Trump is up 6 points, Rubio is up 4 points, Bush up 2: 
The 2nd tier in Iowa: Christie/Fiorina/Huckabee 3, Kasich/Paul 2, Graham/Santorum 1, Gilmore/Pataki 0 supporters: 
Our new Iowa poll: Trump 28, Cruz 25, Rubio 14, Carson 10, Bush 7. No one else over 3: 
Thx 
Our Iowa poll coming tomorrow finds by a 27 point margin that Trump voters think Japanese internment was good 
Poll where we found Serena at 70/8 w/ D's, 39/20 w/ GOP one of our most telling of year imo: 
trowaman student union. I'd take you up on that if I had more time! 
Austin, TX. It is truly touching to see the signs of our work wherever I travel through this great nation 
LBJ should have just posted this on social media and said 'that's a you problem' 
I am pretty sure this person is still around and just emails us instead of writing letters when they get polled 
We told you this 3.5 months ago: 
Trump also polling 20-25 when tested in general election match ups as an independent in Iowa 
First night of our Iowa poll- Trump and Cruz at the top with no one else remotely close to them 
Ok, if we poll Alaska 
I think the last 5 months have pretty well backed up a lot of our controversial poll findings from the last 6 years 
61/28 support for the EPA Clean Power Plan in North Carolina, reinforcing the popularity we find for it everywhere: 
73 in North Carolina, including 56 of Republicans, support increasing minimum wage to at least $10 an hour: 
Thom Tillis finishing his first year in the Senate with a 28/35 approval- has never seen his popularity grow: 
Only 7 of ECU fans disapproved of the job Ruffin McNeill did as football coach. Left with 50 approval: 
Larry Fedora unsurprisingly has become much more popular with UNC fans- 66/5 approval compared to 42/13 last season: 
UNC fans still say 54/35 they'd rather win a title in basketball than football even after good season on gridiron: 
College football loyalties in NC are pretty stable- UNC 27, Duke and NC State 14, ECU 9, Appalachian 5, Wake 4: 
When we polled this week last year Ron Rivera had a 37/32 approval rating with Panthers fans. Now it's 81/3: 
Only other team besides the Panthers where we've measured such blatant bandwagon growth was the 2014 Royals: 
Over last year Panthers fandom in NC has gone from 34 (3-8-1) to 40 (division champs) to 51 (5-0) to 60 (12-0):

Deborah Ross strong early favorite for Democratic Senate nomination in NC- 41 to 15 Kevin Griffin, 5 Chris Rey: 
Richard Burr's approval split 3 ways- 33/34/33. Leads Deborah Ross and Kevin Griffin 46/35, Chris Rey 47/33: 
Cooper leads Ken Spaulding 54/10 in the primary, pretty similar margin to his 58/13 lead in October: 
McCrory's unpopular (38/44 approval) while Cooper remains relatively unknown (46 no opinion about him): 
Our last 8 NC-Gov polls- McCrory led 4, Cooper led 4, neither ever led by more than 3 pts. Toss up: 
Our final North Carolina Governor poll of the year finds Pat McCrory leading Roy Cooper 44-42: 
Still some time to get in Iowa question suggestions for this weekend: 
It's early but the 2 Survey USA polls from CA I just retweeted show strong agreement from GOP voters with Trump's statement this week

Democratic side in North Carolina- Clinton 60, Sanders 21, O'Malley 10. Clinton was up 61/24 in October, stable: 
Jeb Bush in 5th place at 5 in NC but more notably has a 31/48 favorability with GOP voters- quite unpopular:

Cruz is the most frequent 2nd choice overall in NC- 18- and also 2nd choice of Trump voters (22 to 17 Carson): 
Cruz has the momentum in NC. He's gone from a tie for 4th at 6 in October up to now 2nd place at 16: 
Concentrated among Trump voters, but a full 32 of NC Republicans think Islam should be illegal. 41 ok with it:

Second tier in NC: Bush 5, Christie 4, Kasich 3, Fiorina/Huckabee/Paul 2, Graham/Santorum 1, Gilmore/Pataki lt;1: 
Our new NC poll- Trump 33, Cruz 16, Carson/Rubio 14. No one else over 5:

charles_gaba just among GOP voters supporting Trump for nomination 
wccubbison Overall 35 want to shut down mosques, 33 opposed- so much more concentrated in his base than overall GOP

64/28 support for the EPA Clean Power Plan in NH, including 65/26 with independents. Popular everywhere: 
One reason for shifts in Obamacare polling- Dems now more united in support than GOP is in opposition:

We consistently find greater than 80 support even with GOP primary voters, even in places like South Carolina 
Dems (73/6) a lot more likely than GOP (29/20) to think answer to WWJD when it comes to the refugees is accept them: 
By a 37 point margin (51/14) New Hampshire voters think Jesus would say to take the Syrian refugees: 
Beyond 89 support for background checks, NH voters also support assault weapons ban 49/41: 
89 of NH voters support background checks on all gun purchases, only 8 opposed- 93 of Dems, 81 of GOP support: 
Generic D leads Generic R 42/40 for NH-Gov. But Chris Sununu leads Colin Van Ostern 40/34 and Mark Connolly 40/36: 
NathanKleinDC The usual accusation is we have numbers too good for Dems early, then make them worse as the election gets closer 
This is a conspiracy theory about us that I had not heard before 
Clinton in NH leads Rubio 44/43, Fiorina 45/44, Bush 43/41, Carson 45/43, Trump 47/41, and Cruz 47/39: 
Sanders in NH leads Rubio 45/41, Carson 46/41, Fiorina 48/40, Bush 47/38, Trump 49/40, and Cruz 48/38:

Trump body man told woman in front of me: 'don't ask him to sign your boob' 
Went to Trump rally to see his supporters in person and see if I believe all our findings about things they think. Conclusion: yepppp 
We're up to 6 Black Lives Matter protest disruptions of this rally. Very well coordinated effort in all different parts of arena 
Questioner: what can we do to make sure the refugees coming into America will remain celibate? Trump: I'm not even going to go there 
Questioner asked Trump to promise he would say illegal alien instead of illegal immigrant and he actually kinda didn't take the bait 
Crowd questioner: 'I'm in favor of Hillary for Prison. Will you at least consider that?' Crowd goes crazy  
Crowd questioner: 'first of all I'd like to say Merry Christmas.' Trump: 'we're going to bring back Merry Christmas!' Crowd goes crazy 
Crowd question: what would you say to President Obama? (Trump interrupts): you're fired! Crowd goes crazy  
15 minutes and 3 separate protestor disruptions already for  very combative night on the trail 
DKElections I think of this as sociological study night 
_Choo__Choo_ I am just an observer tonight haha you don't need to worry about that 
MannAtlanta not a ton in the crowd but his state director is African American and the invocation was given by an African American preacher 
Crowd at Trump 30 minutes to show time. 8,000ish seat arena, already almost completely full 
'Bomb the hell out of ISIS' pins being sold on way in to Trump rally- 1 for 5 dollars, 3 for 10 dollars 
About a half mile long line to get into Trumps rally in Raleigh tonight 
David_Laxton43 do you think the sun will rise in the east? (Hopefully traffic shouldn't be too bad, smaller crowd than anything at PNC) 
David_Laxton43 just getting better every day! 
Still some time to get in North Carolina question suggestions for this weekend: 
85/9 support for expanded background checks in NH the last time we polled it 
woodruffbets sahilkapur Huckabee/Pataki/Santorum 1, Gilmore/Graham 0 ! 
"The only other candidate with any momentum in the Granite State is Ted Cruz" = won't highlight it 
nuccbko Yes at this link: :) 
For some reason people call PPP to see if they can get tickets to the Trump rally in Raleigh tomorrow 
Taking North Carolina question suggestions for this weekend: 
He totally stole that from Bruno: 
Appreciate the egg letting us know it's only the 'suspect mosques' 
90 of NH Dems think Christianity should be legal, 58 of NH GOP think Islam should be legal 
Clinton leads Sanders 48/39 among Ds in NH, but Sanders leads Clinton 48/39 with indys leading to overall basic tie: 
Sanders easily most popular with Dems in NH at 78/12 fav to 68/22 for Clinton. O'Malley at 38/14, 48 no opinion: 
Dems still very tight in NH- Clinton 44, Sanders 42, O'Malley 8. Sanders +9, O'Malley +4, Clinton +3 from October: 
Carson falling in NH as elsewhere- was 1st or 2nd choice for 26 in October, 16 now. Fav drop from 60/26 to 52/30: 
Rubio in a holding pattern in NH. 12 with 55/25 fav in October, 11 with 54/26 fav now. 2nd most common 2nd choice: 
Trump voters oppose an assault weapons ban 20/66. But support assault weapons ban just for Muslims 56/22: 
On all these Islamophobia questions Trump voters just in a totally different world from the rest of the GOP base: 
Supporters of ALL 13 other GOP hopefuls oppose Muslim registry, oppose closing mosques. Trump's strongly favor both: 
49 of Trump voters in NH support shutting down mosques in the United States, only 18 opposed to doing that:

Kasich fav in NH has gone from 49/22 in August to 45/29 in October to now 38/35. More voters see, less they like: 
Other loser on NH poll is Kasich. Was in top 4, double digits, in August and October. Now 6th place at 8: 
Biggest dropper in NH is Jeb Bush- from 5th place and 9 in October to now 8th place at 5. 38/45 favorability: 
Cruz is most frequent 2nd choice in NH and maybe more important clear 2nd choice of Trumpers (26 to 14 Christie): 
The other candidate on the rise in NH is Ted Cruz- from 6th place and 8 in October to now 2nd place and 13: 
Christie's net favorability in NH has improved 50 points since August- from -11 at 35/46 then to +39 at 61/22 now: 
Chris Christie now has the best favorability rating of any candidate in New Hampshire at 61/22: 
Second tier in New Hampshire- Huckabee/Pataki/Santorum 1, Graham/Gilmore lt;1 rounding down to zero: 
New NH numbers- Trump 27, Cruz 13, Rubio 11, Christie 10, Carson 9, Kasich 8, Fiorina 6, Bush 5, Paul 4: 
NH poll coming out in the next hour. Biggest story- Christie on the move 
Gun owners overwhelmingly want gun legislation: 
skoczela tomorrow 
Hey Ann! We polled this for you in NH and over 90 of Dems think Christianity should be legal. Have a blessed one! 
This is from polling we did even before last week's Colorado Springs shooting 
TurnerWalston yes! Shut up already. That's not how we should act here anyway 
briantashman I just mean that we'll have numbers on it on our NH poll, not that they're particularly alarming 
briantashman stay tuned! 
Everyone who knows me definitely comments on my megalomanicality, it's true 
I unfollowed you and stopped looking at your polls but I'm still taking time out of my day to tell you that 
Still some time to get in New Hampshire question suggestions for this week: 
That was a quite a ' I guess this is 'Our State.'   
Taking question suggestions for a New Hampshire poll early next week: 
Lol ok 
Sorry to hear that. We are a polling company 
Happy Thanksgiving! Even to our trolls. Actually, especially to our trolls 
In Falls Park in downtown Greenville, SC (didn't explain to my Grandmother why I was taking pictures of graffiti) 
BenjySarlin the how to deal with your relatives genre is one even we don't want to encourage 
I AM VERY MAD YOU DID A SILLY POLL ON A HOLIDAY WEEK 
We're not going to find a question that better measures reflexive opposition to the President than GOP voters opposing Turkey pardons 
Our Thanksgiving Poll was pretty much completely crowd sourced so thanks to all of you for the suggestions: 
51 say it's stuffing, 34 say it's dressing. Another generational divide- older people are  
So basically with generational change Cranberry Sauce dying, Mac and Cheese rising  
70 of younger voters are down with Mac and Cheese at Thanksgiving, but only 49 of seniors are: 
59 say Macaroni and Cheese is acceptable Thanksgiving side dish, 27 say not ok. 63 of Dems, 53 of GOP approve: 
Americans prefer Mashed Potatoes to Sweet Potatoes 55/34. And say 54/30, no marshmallows in the Sweet Potatoes: 
Pie poll: Pumpkin Pie 27, Apple Pie/Pecan Pie 17, Sweet Potato Pie/Chocolate Pie 6, Blueberry Pie/Cherry Pie 5: 
There is a massive generational divide on cranberry sauce. Seniors like it 80/17, young voters don't 42/48: 
54 of Americans think it's too early for Christmas music, 34 think it's fine. Bipartisan agreement on that one: 
21 of Republicans think Starbucks is part of the War on Christmas, 47 don't. So more than that driving 36/38 fav: 
Starbucks favorability with Democrats: 47/14. With Republicans: 26/28: 
Only 11 of Republicans approve of Obama's Turkey pardons last year, 59 of Dems do. Peak polarization 
By a 27 point margin Republicans disapprove of Obama pardoning 2 turkeys last year instead of just one: 
Trump leads among GOP voters for nomination, but Carson beats him out 31/24 for preferred Thanksgiving dinner guest: 
Who voters would want to come over for Thanksgiving- Clinton 24, Carson 18, Trump 17, Sanders 11, Cruz 8: 
Candidate most likely to wreck Thanksgiving if they came over- Trump 46, Clinton 22, Sanders 7, Bush/Carson 6:

Sorry for not being boring

Proud of our 9-24 LA poll release showing Edwards way up on Vitter, which at the time was a finding out of nowhere: 
In our national poll before Paris Lindsey was at 1 and in our national poll after Paris Lindsey was at 1 
DignityDefense It's a misread of the chart by the person you're retweeting 
_Choo__Choo_ The people say it's stuffing. Although the old people say it's dressing 
johnmanuelba arguably the most underrated player of UNC's golden years imo. PJ v. Sonny Gray in first ever game at TD Ameritrade 
We will be releasing important new research Monday on generational divides about the acceptability of various Thanksgiving side dishes 
Our national poll found that supporters of Cruz (41/27) and Trump (37/27) want all the mosques in the US shut down 
Even among GOPers 54 say gay marriage hasn't been a negative which may be why Huckabee/Santorum are at Kids Table: 
And we continue to find that 72 of voters nationally say gay marriage hasn't adversely affected their lives: 
62/30 support nationally for the EPA's Clean Power Plan nationally, mirroring out state by state findings: 
Among Democratic voters 62 support $12 minimum wage, but only 36 support $15. Clinton's position is the base's: 
Presidential field may not want to, but 58 of actual GOP voters support increasing minimum wage to $10 or more: 
73 of Americans support increasing minimum wage to at least $10 an hour, only 13 favor current level:

86 of Americans support background checks on all gun purchases, only 8 opposed: 
Republicans lead the generic Congressional ballot nationally 45/43, thanks to a 43/32 advantage with independents: 
We're finding a fair number of Dems support Ryan as Speaker, and I imagine it is a lesser of evils choice for many 
McConnell so unpopular with GOP nationally (15/62 approval), that his numbers are actually better with Dems (18/53): 
While Ryan is decently popular, things couldn't be much worse for Mitch McConnell. 15 approve, 59 disapprove: 
Ryan doesn't have any issue with Republican base- 62/15 favorability, and they support his becoming Speaker 69/14: 
49 of voters nationally support Ryan becoming Speaker, only 27 opposed. Even Ds (35/36) not too negative about it: 
Paul Ryan's Speakership is off to a good start. 41/35 fav nationally is better than any Presidential candidate: 
sundancemckay DKElections appreciate that but the calls to my cell phone between 2 and 6 AM were certainly venomous 
nataliemjb DKElections it's a joke referring to the venom we had heaped on us for being paid to do our post debate poll 
YouGov poll finds those who watched debate Saturday night think Clinton won by 40 points  
Welcome to our lives: 
ok 
Hope no one was under the impression anyone learned any lessons from 2012 
Trump trails Carson head to head, basically tied with Rubio and Cruz head to head, but leads Bush by 22 
O'Malley at 7 for Dems, Bush at 5 for GOP on our new national poll 
Clinton up 46/41 on Fiorina. Others 1 or 2 pts- 46/45 v. Carson, 45/44 v. Trump, 46/44 v. Cruz, 43/41 v. Bush: 
Only GOPer to lead Clinton nationally is Marco Rubio at 45/43. Rubio also only candidate with positive favorability: 
General election matches for President nationally are very close- Clinton within 2 points of 5 out of 6 Republicans: 
Clinton leads Sanders just 47/32 with men, but 69/22 with women. 53/32 with younger voters, but 66/17 with seniors: 
Clinton leads Sanders just 50/36 with white voters, but 70/13 with African Americans, 84/8 with Hispanics: 
Our last national poll not including Biden, in July, was Clinton 57, Sanders 22. Now Clinton 59, Sanders 26. Steady: 
Democratic field nationally: Clinton 59, Sanders 26, O'Malley 7. Think that's O'Malley's best national poll ever: 
GOP Presidential candidates are well to the right of the GOP base on issues like background checks, minimum wage: 
And 56 of GOP primary voters nationally support increasing the minimum wage to at least $10 an hour: 
As conservative as they are overall, 81 of GOP primary voters support background checks on all gun purchases: 
Cruz (41/27), Trump (37/27) voters want to shut down all mosques in US. Carson (17/43), Rubio (25/37) voters don't: 
27 of Republican primary voters support shutting down all the mosques in the country, 38 opposed, 35 not sure: 
If Republicans had to choose just between Rubio and Cruz as their nominee, Rubio comes out ahead 43/38: 
Head to heads between Carson and Rubio/Cruz very close- leads Rubio 43/42, trails Cruz 44/41: 
Though he leads overall Trump doesn't do great in head to heads- trails Carson 50/41, Cruz 46/44. Leads Rubio 46/44: 
If Romney entered race he'd be in 6th place- Trump 24, Carson 19, Cruz 17, Rubio 11, Bush 8, Romney 7: 
Only 20 of Republicans nationally want Mitt Romney to run for President, 66 say he should stay out of race: 
Mike Huckabee (29 pt improvement), Lindsey Graham (14 pts), Chris Christie (9 pts) all have favorabilities on rise: 
Ben Carson finally maybe cracking a little- fav has dropped from 71/16 to 61/24. Still most popular GOPer though: 
Bush has 27/50 favorability with GOP voters. Neither 'very conservative' (22/58) nor moderate (23/52) ones like him: 
Jeb Bush the biggest dropper nationally on GOP side- has lost half of support since early October- 10 down to 5: 
Cruz is leading the GOP field with 'very conservative' voters- 29 to 24 Trump, 22 Carson- and with Tea Partiers: 
Ted Cruz is the only candidate with momentum in the GOP race. Has doubled support from 7 to 14 over last 6 weeks: 
In early October our national poll was Trump 27, Carson 17. Now Trump 26, Carson 19. Not much change at the top: 
And joining Jim Gilmore and Bobby Jindal in the rounding down to 0 club on our national poll is Rick Santorum: 
Second tier of GOP nationally- Bush 5, Fiorina/Huckabee 4, Christie/Kasich 3, Paul 2, Graham/Pataki 1: 
Our new national poll: Trump 26, Carson 19, Cruz 14, Rubio 13. Very clear top 4- no one else over 5: 
Sharpe222 1 pt ahead 
We'll have our new national GOP poll tmrw. Only 2 candidates have seen meaningful change in their support since October- Cruz up, Bush down 
Among Trump supporters 37 support shutting down the mosques in the US, 27 opposed 
66 of Republicans nationally say they don't want Mitt Romney to run for President, only 7 say they would support him in current field 
On our final national poll including him Bobby Jindal ended up with 2 supporters 
In 2010 we found Jindal to be the most popular Governor in the country. Leaving office as quite possibly the least: 
2nd choice of Jindal supporters (about 40) on our last Iowa poll: Carson 37, Cruz 22, Rubio 12 
59 of gun owners think NRA has generally lost its way from mission of supporting gun safety:

Despite (or maybe bc of?) Haley's popularity, only 25 in SC want to see her as VP candidate next year, 59 don't: 
Striking in Haley's numbers is 45/30 approval with African Americans- earned a lot of goodwill with flag issue: 
Nikki Haley's become one of the most popular Governors in the country- 56/28 approval. 71/18 w/GOP, 40/42 w/Dems:

Tim Scott leads Joyce Dickerson 53/25 for reelection next year in SC Senate race: 
Our new SC poll finds Tim Scott (46/25 approval) beats out Lindsey Graham (30/51) by a long shot in popularity: 
We found 55/38 support in LA last year for increase to $10.10 minimum wage 
Smart take 
B_D_Silver We're going to test Romney nationally this week to see what people think! But no, don't think there's much appetite for moderate 
Our latest SC poll found Haley with 56/28 approval bc she's respected by black voters and break even w/ Dems overall 
CBS poll finds- just as we did- that Hillary Clinton won last night's debate by a wide margin: 
Pre-screened those who were planning to watch the debate Thursday and Friday

Our national post debate poll of Dem primary voters finds 67 think Clinton won to 20 for Sanders, 7 O'Malley: 
What would be some fun Thanksgiving related poll questions? 
Taking question suggestions for a national poll next week: 
We tested Mitt in Iowa in September and he only got 7, tying him for 5th. Little interest from actual GOP voters in his coming back 
We've repeatedly found a majority of GOP primary voters support increasing minimum wage to at least $10 an hour 
Jindal's people attacked us hard when we first started showing him with horrible approval ratings. Accepted fact now 
We polled 787 Republicans last weekend and 32 of them supported someone in this debate 
We found way back in the early days of PPP that 62 of Republicans wanted the government to stay out of Medicare 
RawlsRorty Yes I generally think that 5 of people will say just about anything, so this is actually below that threshold 
3 Aliens, 2 Lindsey, this is true 
Maddow forum Friday reinforced Clinton's advantage in SC- 67 who watched thought she won, 16 Sanders, 6 O'Malley: 
Clinton up 79/14 w/ Dems in SC, but only 40/37 w/ non-Dems planning to vote in primary. Puts overall lead at 72/18: 
Clinton leads Sanders 86/11 w/ black voters in SC. Troubles w/ non-white voters big problem for Sanders post-IA/NH: 
alexburnsNYT 16/45 with 'very conservative' voters so guessing the exposure he's gotten in debates hasn't helped him on the right 
Democratic side in South Carolina- Clinton 72, Sanders 18, O'Malley 5. Clinton led Sanders 66/12 in September: 
Favorabilities on the down swing in SC- Kasich has gone from 27/34 to 23/40, Fiorina from 54/22 to 49/26: 
Not much support for nomination still, but Chris Christie's net fav has improved 42 pts in SC, from 28/55 to 44/29: 
In February Bush led South Carolina at 19. Now in 5th at 8. Has 36/46 favorability rating: 
SC Republicans aren't buying the Jeb reboot so far- only 26 think 'Jeb can fix it,' 55 say he can't: 
Graham had built back popularity w/ SC GOP earlier this yr- was up to 54/29 approval. Now has squandered it- 38/49: 
Lindsey Graham was at 13 in SC in February, now 2. 84 think he should drop out, only 11 want him to stay in: 
Thanks for chiming in 
Rubio's gone from 4 to 13 in SC, 60/22 fav makes him 2nd most popular candidate. 2nd most frequent 2nd choice too: 
Cruz has gone from 6 to 15 in SC and leads with TP voters and those most concerned w/ having conservative nominee: 
Candidates with momentum in South Carolina are Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio- they're both up 9 points from September: 
Only 7 of GOP primary voters in SC think the pyramids were for storing grain, but that belief isn't hurting Carson: 
65 say Carson's 'violent youth' makes no difference to them, 9 more likely to vote for him, 22 less likely: 
Carson's recent controversy seems to have had no effect. Was at 21 in SC in Sept., 21 now. 69/17 fav easily best: 
Large gender gap in South Carolina- Carson leads Trump 27/19 with women, but Trump leads Carson 31/15 with men: 
Winnowing before SC would hurt Trump too- trails Carson 51/38 h2h, ties with Rubio at 46 and with Cruz at 44: 
Even though Trump is still ahead in SC, since September he's dropped from 37 to 25, fav from 64/28 to 53/33: 
2nd tier of GOP candidates in SC: Kasich 3, Graham/Huckabee/Paul 2, Christie/Santorum 1, Gilmore/Jindal/Pataki lt;1: 
Our new SC poll: Trump 25, Carson 21, Cruz 15, Rubio 13, Bush 8, Fiorina 5. No one else gets more than 3: 
84 of South Carolina Republicans want Lindsey Graham to drop out, only 11 think he should keep at it 
Carson 26, Rubio 26, Trump 19, Cruz 11 among the (small) pyramids were for storing grain crowd 
Pyramid polling was done by overwhelming popular demand 
65 of SC Republicans say it doesn't make a difference to them whether Ben Carson stabbed his friend or tried to hit his mom with a hammer 
PPP is part of the Benghazi cover up, dang it you got us 
76 of SC Republicans think the pyramids were for burying the dead, 7 think they were for storing grain, 3 for the usage of aliens 
Our new SC poll finds only 26 of Republicans there think 'Jeb can fix it,' 55 think he can't 
LOL 
What purpose do you think the ancient pyramids were built for: burying the dead, storing grain, or something for the usage of aliens?  
We also found Trump still modestly ahead in Iowa this week 
Christie's actually posting his best favorability numbers in months right now, just not translating to actual support for nomination yet 
Still some time to get in South Carolina questions for this weekend: 
PSTroutman 
Thom Tillis has a 28 approval, 36 disapproval. Even a year after the ads stopped, not much recovery in his image:

74 support in NC for increasing minimum wage to at least $10 an hour, including from 57 of Republicans:

43 of NC voters support Paul Ryan becoming Speaker, 26 opposed. 62/13 with GOP. Ryan's favorability is 39/31: 
Despite unpopularity of NC legislature, GOP leads 43/42 on generic ballot- would lead to pretty status quo election: 
Month after leaving town things aren't getting much better for the NC General Assembly- 14 approve, 64 disapprove: 
The Board of Governors as a body is somewhat unpopular- 14 favorable, 34 unfavorable. But again 52 no opinion:

Ron Rivera had a 37/32 approval with Panthers fans last December before the streak started. Now it's 71/5: 
Overall 51 in NC are Panthers fans, 10 Cowboys, 8 Steelers, 6 Patriots/Redskins, 5 Packers: 
Last December only 34 of North Carolinians said they were Panthers fans- now 51. I think there's a term for that: 
FB coach approvals in NC- Cutcliffe 59/7, McNeill 56/1, Doeren 50/3, Fedora 49/7, Satterfield 45/5, Clawson 33/17: 
Our annual poll on college football loyalties in NC- UNC 22, Duke 15, NC State 14, ECU 12, App 10, Wake 3:

Our new IA poll finds Hillary Clinton doing an avg of 5 pts better in match ups with GOP than she was a month ago: 
Our June KY poll warned of potential for Dem wipe out. Only Grimes and Beshear overcame it: 
PaulBennecke limited public polling budget, public a little more interested in early state Clinton and Trump than Conway and Bevin... 
PaulBennecke we did not do a KY poll last week public or private. The June one is the last one 
In Chapel Hill PPP is the AP 
Seismic upset  
 
arthomason you missed out

John Kasich's polling at 2 in Iowa and his favorability (22/37) is almost the same as Lindsey Graham's (20/38):

Carly Fiorina's dropped from 13 to 5 in Iowa since September. Rand Paul has dropped as well, from 4 to 2:

We had Rubio in 2nd at 12 in NH two weeks ago. Not sure this is a debate surge for him 
Rand supporters spending their Halloween demanding we furnish them a link to a poll we released 3 months ago 
evantheross coopers generally had a big lead over McCrory with young voters, just a temporary blip this month most likely 
UofAlec yes he got 2 in NC this week. Had been getting 0 most everywhere else before all those others dropped out 
mofopolitics no I don't have a cat 
Today someone came up to me on the bus and said can you put my cat in a poll and I thought about it and said sure why not 
Taking Iowa question suggestions for this weekend: 
charlie_putnam no, just because most Democrats will vote Democratic whether they've actually heard of the person or not 
Big picture in NC remains the same- toss up Governor's race, Burr favored but with mediocre approval numbers: 
Ross also trails Richard Burr only 43/39. Burr has wider leads of 44/35 over Griffin and 45/34 over Rey: 
Deborah Ross off to a good start in Senate bid- getting 33 of primary vote to 16 for Kevin Griffin, 6 Chris Rey:

Deez Nuts got 9 as an independent in NC 
North Carolinians are pulling for Mets over Royals 40/26. Don't know if that's a Harvey effect or general sentiment in neutral territories 
Jim Webb gets 8 as indy in NC- actually gets more GOP vote (40) than Democratic vote (26). Deez Nuts got 9 tho: 
Sanders does on average 5 points worse than Clinton against GOP in NC- down 11 to Carson, 7 to Trump, 6 to Bush:

Jim Webb gets 8 as an independent in NC, less than the 9 Deez Nuts got as one when we polled in August 
Rick Santorum's the only person in the undercard debate Wednesday who's not polling at 0 on our new NC poll (he gets 2) 
Trump's at 31 in our new NC poll, the highest we've found him yet. His 'slump' seems to be confined to Iowa at this point 
Lindsey Graham's gone from 0 to 2 to 0 over our last 3 NC polls (that's supporters, not percents) 
ImpactDemocracy lessig we have included him in all polls the last 2 months 
I think the person who just called my cell at 6:45 on Saturday night wanting Jill Stein and Gary Johnson put in our polls needs a new hobby 
Hillary right around 70 on the first night of our North Carolina poll. Was at 55 on our last Biden-less poll 
jbview Let us know what response options you think we should include besides Senator and community organizer and we'd be glad to next week 
Here are all the leftovers from our New Hampshire polling this week: 
If you reallocate Chafee voters to their second choice in our most recent poll...lol who are we kidding 
BullCityVA actually you never got the text 
Thx to questioner for writing our next poll 
Mike Huckabee was at 1 in our New Hampshire poll this week and trailed Hillary by 16 points in the general 
10 of Americans think Benghazi is in Egypt, 8 think it's in Syria, 4 think it's in Iran, 3 think it's in Cuba: 
In 2013 we found that only 58 of Americans actually know where Benghazi is: 
petitions signed by 10 people to get pollsters to include Cthulhu in polls is the new thing 
Still some time to get North Carolina question suggestions in for this weekend: 
Taking question suggestions for our North Carolina poll this week: 
emmajconeroddy Every candidate has a few annoying supporters! 
LOL 
Because Hillary is the overwhelming favorite to be the Democratic nominee 
Well there you go 
I can't handle all this rediorec 
Sanders leads Trump 49/40, Carson 47/39, and Rubio 45/41 in New Hampshire: 
Sanders actually does slightly better than Clinton in NH, leading Carson/Rubio/Trump by average 7 pts to her 6 pts: 
Clinton leads Trump 47/41, Carson and Rubio both 48/42, Cruz 50/37, and Huckabee 51/35 (!) in New Hampshire: 
The GOPers besides Kasich who come closest to Clinton in NH- Christie at 45/44, Bush at 45/41, Fiorina at 46/42: 
Hillary Clinton leads 8 out of 9 Republicans in NH. The one exception is John Kasich who ties her at 44: 
Neck and neck NH polling really reminds me of the MT and VA Senate races in 2012 that eventually went with the tide: 
Ayotte upside down approval mostly bc she's at only 45/44 with 'very conservative' voters- will still vote for her: 
New Hampshire Senate race neck and neck even though Hassan (50/39) has a much better approval than Ayotte (40/42): 
Our new NH poll once again finds a 1 point race for Senate- Maggie Hassan leads Kelly Ayotte 44-43: 
2nd choice of Biden voters on our recent polls- Clinton 40, Sanders 15 in NH, Clinton 44, Sanders 21 national, Clinton 43, Sanders 15 in IA 
Taniel 3 points. Will get full thing out later once whatever about's to happen has settled 
Joe Biden leads Donald Trump 51-40, Ben Carson 48-39, and Marco Rubio 47-40 in NH, getting this out while it has a small shred of relevance 
MysteryPollster congratulations Mark! 
Take a deep breathe 
Yep 
Results of our polling on who voters in each party want the other side to nominate

Rubio the biggest gainer in our new New Hampshire poll 
EAPhoneHome yes 
Re: Webb running indy and who it would hurt. On our NH poll 16 of Republicans, 2 of Democrats said they wanted Webb as Dem nominee 
Among NH D's looking for someone easy to beat in fall 50 say they want Trump to be GOP nominee, 15 Bush, 10 Cruz: 
Kasich being top choice of Dems in NH might be why he is also polling at 1 with 'very conservative' voters there: 
Who Democrats in NH would support for the Republican nomination: Kasich 22, Trump 17, Bush 10, Christie/Fiorina 7: 
John Kasich's kind of stalled in NH. Was 2nd with 11 and 49/22 fav in August. Now 4th with 10 and 45/29 fav: 
Carly Fiorina's dropped from 3rd place and 10 in NH in August to now 7th place and 7 in our new poll: 
Donald Trump gets 25 with Evangelicals in New Hampshire. Mike Huckabee gets 3, Rick Santorum 1: 
NH yet another state where Carson is most popular Republican (60/26 fav) and the most frequent 2nd choice (15): 
Candidates on the rise in NH since August- Rubio's gone from 4 to 12, Carson from 6 to 11, Cruz from 4 to 8: 
Trump leads Bush 49/41 head to head in NH but trails Carson 48/39, Rubio 49/42, and Fiorina 47/44:

Second tier of GOP field in NH- Santorum 2, Graham/Huckabee/Jindal/Pataki 1, Gilmore lt;1: 
Republican field in NH- Trump 28, Rubio 12, Carson 11, Kasich 10, Bush 9, Cruz 8, Fiorina 7, Paul 4, Christie 3: 
Who NH GOP voters looking for someone they think they could beat in the general want to get Dem nod- Sanders 26, Chafee 19, Biden 17 
Who Republicans in NH would support for Dem nomination: Biden/Sanders 20, Webb 16, Clinton 9, O'Malley 8, Chafee 7: 
Clinton actually beats out Biden 24/21 even when it comes to 2nd choice in NH. Clinton leads Sanders 45/35 wo Biden: 
Joe Biden is the most broadly liked Dem in NH- 78/10 fav. But only gets 11 support when it comes to nomination: 
Clinton leads Sanders 47/29 w/ Dems in NH. But Sanders up 40/32 w/ third of primary electorate that's independents: 
ActorAaronBooth That's the second choice question 
Clinton leads Sanders 50/24 w/ seniors, 47/31 w/ women, by at least 8 w/ every ideology group besides 'very liberal' 
Key for Clinton in NH- cutting losses w/strong Bernie groups- down 1 w/ 'very liberal,' men, down 8 w/young voters: 
Clinton's net favorability has improved 18 pts in New Hampshire since August. Was +38 (63/25), now +56 (73/17):

Hillary's back up in New Hampshire- 41 to 33 Sanders, 11 Biden, 4 O'Malley, 2 Chafee/Webb: 
Jim Webb's at 16 in our New Hampshire poll! (of who Republicans want to be the Democratic nominee) 
Bucs fans obv like Clint Hurdle (59/6 approval.) Phils fans not sure about hiring Mackanin- 62 no opinion on hire: 
Cheesesteaks have an overall 48/8 fav in PA, but 45 have no opinion. Can't match the popularity of cheese in WI: 
The most important poll finding from PA- 52 of Dems, only 37 of GOP have a positive opinion of cheesesteaks: 
College sports loyalties in PA- Penn State 44, Pitt 17, Temple 13. Franklin has 50/11 approval, Narduzzi 47/10: 
73 of PA voters say gay marriage has had either positive or no impact on their lives. 27 claim it's been negative: 
Even among Dems Kathleen Kane has 26/32 fav, 37/34 think she should resign, just 27 think she should run again: 
Kathleen Kane has 17/41 fav, voters think she should resign 45/25, only 18 think she should seek reelection: 
Pope Francis has a 66/13 favorability in PA, voters think Nutter did a good job preparing for visit cc: CahnEmily

Chip Kelly has a 24/37 approval with Eagles fans. It was 62/9 in January: 
Here is what we refer to internally as the 'random crap' portion of our Pennsylvania poll for this week: 
David_Laxton43 have you ever told that woman she's the boss? I bet it would make her week 
Still some time to get in New Hampshire question suggestions for this weekend: 
conservadox tedcruz he trails Clinton 46-40 
carr_laura home state 
day54 No, I think Hillary is probably at a bit of a low point (or was pre debate when the poll was conducted) 
We don't include candidates polling at 1 in the primary in general election match ups, this is true 
DanteAtkins 
Sanders does about same as Clinton in general matches in PA- down 1 to Rubio, 2 to Fiorina, 4 to Trump, 8 to Carson: 
Ben Carson (41/37), Joe Biden (45/42) are the only folks with positive favs among overall electorate in PA: 
Biden is up 46/44 on Carson, 45/43 on Trump, 45/41 on Rubio, and 46/40 on Fiorina in Pennsylvania: 
Biden leads all the GOPers we tested him against in PA, doing on average 6 pts better than Clinton in same matches: 
Clinton trails Carson 47/43, Christie 45/41, Rubio 45/42, Trump 45/43, and Fiorina 43/42 in Pennsylvania: 
Beyond polling at 2 w/ GOP voters and them wanting him to drop out, Santorum also does 2nd worst v. Clinton in PA: 
Clinton leads Kasich 41/39, Bush 45/40, Cruz 46/40, Santorum 47/39, and Huckabee 47/38 in general election in PA: 
General election match ups in PA are a mixed bag- Clinton leads 5 GOPers by 2-9 pts, trails 5 GOPers by 1-4 pts: 
84 of voters in PA support background checks on all gun purchases, only 8 opposed. 91/3 with Dems, 80/10 with GOP: 
Undecided leads Dem primary for Senate in Pennsylvania with 35. Sestak 29, McGinty 22, Fetterman 14: 
Undecided voters in PA-Sen lean Dem prob due to low name rec of candidates- Sestak 41, McGinty 35, Fetterman 22: 
Our PA-Sen numbers all yr have pointed to close race. Toomey has led Sestak by 4, 4, now 3 pts. 1st poll w/ others: 
Toomey leads Joe Sestak 41/38, Katie McGinty 43/36, and John Fetterman 41/34: 
Big part of why Toomey's approval is so low is he's at only 42/27 even w/ GOP. Most will still vote for him though: 
Our new Pennsylvania poll finds Pat Toomey with only a 28 approval rating. it was 30 and 28 our previous 2 polls: 
Percentage of Republicans nationally who think gay marriage isn't a big deal: 57 Percentage of Republicans nationally who support Rand: 2 
alexburnsNYT There were also a bunch of veterans smoking pot outside and the police didn't care. That's my update 
alexburnsNYT The tour guide and I bonded. She told me her office is full of gifts from Asian tourists and they all take selfies with her 
alexburnsNYT I got a one on one tour of the Capital in August because I was the only person there at 1 PM on a Thursday... 
Taking question suggestions for a New Hampshire poll this weekend: And we'll have more from Pennsylvania tomorrow 
NC where we've found Biden strongest, Sanders weakest in our recent polls 
72 of Americans think America is already great: 
We're generally finding Kasich with negative favorabillities among GOP voters the places we poll 
TylerBlackmon I have no idea what you are referring to 
There may be nothing sadder in politics today than a Santorum supporter unskewer 
If you reallocate Biden voters to their second choice in Pennsylvania, Clinton leads Sanders 48/26: 
Democratic side in Pennsylvania: Clinton 40, Sanders 22, Biden 20, Chafee 3, O'Malley 2, Lessig/Webb 1: 
53 of GOP primary voters in Pennsylvania support increasing the minimum wage to at least $10 an hour: 
78 of GOP primary voters in Pennsylvania support background checks on all gun purchases, just 12 opposed: 
Mike Huckabee has dropped from 11 to 3 in Pennsylvania since May. Favorability has gone from 59/21 to 43/34: 
Trump trails Carson 52/38 head to head in PA, trails Rubio 45/44, edges Fiorina 47/43. But blows out Bush 60/31: 
PA makes another state where Jeb Bush is under water even with GOP primary voters- 36 favorable, 45 unfavorable: 
64 of GOP primary voters in PA think it's time for Santorum to drop out, only 23 think he should keep on going: 
Santorum generally becoming less appealing to Pennsylvanians. Favorability was 57/25 w/GOP voters in May, now 46/36: 
Rick Santorum was at front of the pack in PA (2nd place, 12) in May. Now he's entered the rear (10th place, 2): 
Besides Carson only Republican to increase support in PA since May is Ted Cruz, who's gone from T8 (6) to T3 (9): 
PA yet another state where Carson is most popular Republican (64/17 fav), most frequent 2nd choice (20): 
Trump maintaining small overall lead in PA thanks to domination with GOP centrists- 33 to 17 for Carson: 
Trump is actually running 3rd in PA with 'very conservative' voters. Carson gets 31, Cruz 20, Trump just 15: 
The second tier in Pennsylvania: Huckabee/Kasich 3, Santorum 2, Gilmore/Paul 1, Graham/Jindal/Pataki lt;1: 
Trump's 1 point lead over Carson in Pennsylvania is the smallest advantage we've found for him anywhere since July: 
Our new Pennsylvania poll: Trump 24, Carson 23, Cruz/Fiorina 9, Bush/Christie 7, Rubio 6. No one else over 3: 
Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham, and George Pataki each have 1 lonely supporter among Pennsylvania Republicans 
Rick Santorum's polling at 2 in Pennsylvania and 64 of GOP primary voters want him to drop out

ChapelHillNews1 Crayton 
A very polite older man just called and said he didn't want us to call him ever again, but we could fax our questions and he would respond 
MaggiePatton94 I don't think you had Starbucks much when you were 3 
We found yesterday Kevin McCarthy had already managed to get himself to a 12/38 favorability nationally, including 14/33 even with GOP 
David_Laxton43 ouch! Can't remember one of those 
If your numbers don't exactly match the poll averages it now makes you 'so dishonest!' 
RIP Yankees 
In August we found Pat McCrory leading Dan Forest 60/20 in a hypothetical primary, hard to imagine Greg Brannon would do much better 
UofAlec moderates are way more likely to ID Democratic than Republican 
Shout out to earth's most likely voter 
Still some time to get in Pennsylvania question suggestions for this weekend: 
Democrats rooting for Cubs to win World Series, before they got bounced Republicans were rooting for the Yankees: 
Americans are divided on the most important question of our times- 34 think Aaron Rodgers is better, 32 Tom Brady: 
Serena Williams has a 55/14 favorability nationally. But it's 70/8 with Democrats, only 39/20 with Republicans: 
There continues to be strong national support for the EPA's Clean Power Plan- 62 in favor, 31 opposed: 
74 of voters nationally support increasing minimum wage to at least $10 an hour- 93 of D's, 70 of I's, 53 of Rs: 
Overall 43 of voters believe there's liquid water on Mars, 17 don't, and 40 say they're not sure: 
The partisan divide on science- Democrats believe there's liquid water on Mars 53/15, Republicans only do 36/20: 
Only 15 of voters nationally think Iowa and New Hampshire should be allowed to go first every time, 60 opposed: 
Democrats (73) are more in support of Obamacare than Republicans (70) are opposed to it. Intensity gap is gone: 
42 of voters nationally support Obamacare, 40 opposed. Just not the liability for Dems anymore that it used to be: 
By a 33 point margin voters say they're less likely to vote for Senate candidates who support Citizens United: 
Citizens United decision continues to be very unpopular with the public- only 19 of voters support it, 57 opposed: 
88/8 support nationally for background checks on all gun purchases- 93/4 with Dems, 84/11 with GOP, 83/11 w/ indys: 
Part of reason for Davis being so unpopular may be that even w/ GOP, 57 grant gay marriage hasn't been a bad thing: 
74 of voters say gay marriage has had a positive or no impact on their life. Only 26 claim it's been negative: 
Americans don't care for Kim Davis at all- 14 see her favorably, 35 unfavorably. Even GOP voters at 16/23: 
Pope Francis has a 63/16 favorability nationally. 75/8 with Democrats, 60/21 with independents, 49/23 with GOP: 
Overall Congress has an 11/82 approval rating, generic Congressional ballot is tied at 43: 
Voters nationally say they have a higher opinion of Planned Parenthood than Congressional Republicans, 49/37: 
GOP base hates Mitch McConnell so much- 14/67 approval- that he's actually more popular with Democrats (17/59): 
John Boehner is going out with a 21/64 approval rating nationally...which is better than Mitch McConnell's 14/64: 
What's most notable about McCarthy's numbers nationally is even Republicans don't like him- 14/33 within own party: 
Kevin McCarthy has made a very bad first impression nationally- 12 see him favorably, 38 unfavorably: 
We'll be waiting on that check as well as the Soros check 
wccubbison annoying not to know what precincts are out but damn they count fast! 
TurnerWalston some people need to try to be a little more Chapel Hill and a little less Manhattan 
Taking Pennsylvania question suggestions for this weekend: 
EdEspinoza Clinton 43, Sanders 26, Biden 22...of course relatively large MOE for the subgroup 
Sanders does 5 pts worse than HRC in general election matches. Trails Rubio 42/38, Fiorina 44/38, ties Trump at 44: 
Biden does 5 pts better than Clinton in general election matches. Leads Trump 48/40, Fiorina 46/40, Rubio 45/40: 
I truly look forward to the day that elusive Soros money everyone always tells us we're getting comes in 
Other Clinton h2hs: leads Cruz 46/42, Kasich 42/39, Fiorina 44/43. Ties Trump at 44, Rubio at 43. Trails Bush 43/42: 
Mike Huckabee now doing the worst of any GOP candidate against Clinton, trailing 46/39: 
Ben Carson is strongest GOP candidate in general election matches- leads Clinton 48/44, Biden 45/42, Sanders 46/35: 
54 of GOP primary voters support increasing the minimum wage to at least $10 an hour. Base out ahead of candidates: 
Among Jeb Bush voters, there's 82/18 support for expanded background checks: 
82/13 support for expanded background checks with GOP primary voters. Supporters of all 15 candidates are in favor: 
Rand Paul still unpopular with GOP voters- 31/42 fav. Only Bush and Lindsey Graham (18/45) have higher negatives: 
Not translating to more support yet, but Christie has fixed up his image. 43/38 fav compared to 28/54 in August: 
Jeb Bush just keeps getting more unpopular. 34/49 overall favorability, 26/56 with 'very conservative' voters: 
Bottom line on our new GOP poll is it can be good news or bad news for Trump depending on what you pick out. Which feels like new normal! 
Ben Carson continues to be easily the most popular GOP candidate (71/16 fav) and the most frequent 2nd choice (19): 
Only 30 of GOP primary voters believe Trump that his net worth is greater than $5 billion dollars: 
Trump leads Bush 56/36 h2h but trails Fiorina 47/45, Rubio 50/43, Carson 52/41. Last month he led all but Carson: 
News is not all good for Trump on this poll- net fav is down 14 points since late August, trails most head to heads: 
Trump's strongest groups are Tea Party voters (35), younger voters (32), men (31), moderates (29): 
Trump's weakest groups, although he still leads with them, are women (23), Evangelicals (25), seniors (26): 
Trump leads the GOP field within every meaningful group of the electorate we look at, ranging from 23 to 35: 
Fiorina has actually fallen 2 pts from our late August national poll, 8 to 6. She, Trump, Kasich each down 2 pts: 
Rubio only candidate with any sort of momentum on our new national poll- has gone from 5th and 7 to 3rd and 13: 
Trump was at 29 in our national poll at the end of August, 27 now. Sky isn't exactly falling for him: 
The bottom tier of the GOP field nationally- Christie/Paul/Santorum at 2, Graham/Jindal/Pataki at 1, Gilmore lt;1: 
Our new national GOP poll- Trump 27, Carson 17, Rubio 13, Bush 10, Cruz 7, Fiorina 6, Huckabee/Kasich 4: 
Thanks for letting us know 
Groups Dem race is not close with- seniors (C 51, B 23, S 15), blacks (C 51, B 30, S 13), women (C 48, S 22, B 17): 
Groups Dem race is close with- younger voters (Clinton/Sanders tied), 'very liberal' (Clinton +4), men (Clinton +7): 
The takeaway from our new national numbers is that Ds are pretty content with current field, possibly adding Biden: 
In head to heads Clinton would lead Biden 51/38, Sanders 54/34, Warren 58/28, Gore 67/22, and Kerry 69/17: 
When you throw Warren/Gore/Kerry/Dukakis in mix 83 of Clinton voters stay with her, 80 of Biden's, 69 of Sanders' 
We also tested a primary field with EVERYONE- Clinton 37, Biden 20, Sanders 19, Warren 11, Gore 4, Dukakis/Kerry 2: 
Biden voters say Clinton is second choice over Sanders, 44/21. Reallocate them and Clinton leads Sanders 51/28: 
Our new national Democratic poll- Clinton 42, Sanders 24, Biden 20, Webb 2, Chafee/O'Malley 1: 
wcmatthews haven't done the head to heads but his favorability is actually pretty close to break even now 
The worst poll for Donald Trump yet- only 21 of Americans think his net worth is over 5 billion dollars 
Dems are pulling for the Cubs over the Yankees, 16/11. Republicans are pulling for the Yankees over Cubs, 13/11: 
Who people want to win the World Series: Cubs 15, Yankees 11, Dodgers 8, Pirates 7, Cardinals/Royals 6, Mets 5: 
Democrats want the Cubs to win the World Series, Republicans are rooting for the Yankees: 
Also among GOP primary voters nationally- only 17 see Kim Davis favorably, 26 unfavorably. 61 say gay marriage not a big deal 
82/13 support for background checks on all gun sales on our new national poll- among Republican primary voters 
That early burst Fiorina got after the debate seems to have really worn off- at 6 in our new national poll and she had 8 a month ago 
For fun we threw Michael Dukakis into an iteration of the Democratic field on our national poll this weekend. He beat Martin O'Malley 
BullCityVA haven't I ever performed for you my poem about this topic 
_Choo__Choo_ that's fine, I wasn't sure what to say because I was so surprised to see you! Hope the concert is great! 
_Choo__Choo_ I'm still expecting my Easley score updates tonight even if you're down here! 
RaleighReporter awesome- have a good weekend! 
RaleighReporter that's fine, just pointing that this was something appearing on your company's website, not that we came up with on our own 
RaleighReporter we get our ideas from McClatchy: 
Also a big native/non-native difference on the crucial Krispy Kreme v. Dunkin issue 
aaron_strauss you'd have to take that up with Petey Pablo 
Barbecue is the one thing that continues to unite North Carolinians red and blue, young and old, native/transplant 
We found earlier this year that KFC didn't even win the Fast Food chicken loyalty wars in Kentucky 
I didn't know PPP was the MSM 
Fast food chicken preferences still highly partisan-ized with Republicans heavily pro CFA and others more split 
College basketball still huge as North Carolina changes, Nascar not so much 
Also in our 'North Carolina Cultural Poll'- donuts, fast food chicken, real life application of Petey Pablo lyrics: 
Here are new  on how North Carolinians feel about Bigfoot, Nascar, cheerwine, and moonshine for your rain Friday: 
jehb are you getting rained on in the bus? I find that happens more often than not when it's raining... 
davidwave4 lessig we've been including him for over a month now 
BTW in our exhaustive effort to test every Hillary alternative possible Gov Dukakis makes his 1st ever appearance in a PPP poll this weekend 
So what you're saying is you're mad Deez Nuts aren't in the poll anymore? 
David_Laxton43 you seem pretty lenient this week, giving decent ratings to ones you're not all that impressed with 
Still some time to get in question suggestions for our national poll this weekend: 
day54 limited- a lot could change in either direction over that amount of time 
Overall Pope Francis' favorability in North Carolina is 56/18. A little better than Coach K and Roy! 
Pope Francis favorability in NC is 66/8 with Dems, 43/29 with Republicans. Interesting to see national numbers this weekend after Davis news 
always appreciate the smart takes 
Among GOP voters in NC- 89 support background checks, 51 EPA Clean Power Plan, 51 increase to $10 minimum wage: 
89 support, only 7 opposition in North Carolina to background checks on all gun purchases: 
70 of NC voters support increasing minimum wage to at least $10 an hr, 26 say keep it where it is/get rid of it: 
67 of voters in NC support the EPA Clean Power Plan, 28 opposed. Very popular everywhere we poll: 
Thom Tillis continues to not be very popular- 26 approve of him, 39 disapprove. Ads still haven't worn off: 
Only 22 of NC voters support move toward partisan judicial elections, 47 opposed. Opposition across party lines: 
Democrats lead generic legislative ballot in NC 45/41. Decent, but much smaller than lead at end of 2013 session: 
Republicans (19/60), independents (13/63), Democrats (11/63) in NC all give General Assembly very poor reviews: 
The longer it stayed the less popular the NC General Assembly got- finished up with 14 approval, 62 disapproval: 
Big part of Burr's overall approval  being so bad is he's at only 47/23 w/ GOP. Most will still vote for him tho: 
Burr is up 42/37 on Heath Shuler, 45/35 on Duane Hall, 45/34 on Deborah Ross, 46/34 on Chris Rey: 
Richard Burr has a 29/40 approval spread...but leads potential Democratic opponents by 5-11 points: 
49 of North Carolinians have no opinion about Roy Cooper. 27/24 fav with those who do: 
Despite holding slight lead, McCrory's approval this month comes in at 35/47 spread. Under water 26 months in a row: 
Our new NC poll continues to find a close race for Governor, with Pat McCrory leading Roy Cooper 44-41 this month: 
We found him at 26 in NC this week, compared to 24 in mid-August. Not much of a fade 
Trump loses head to head in NC to everyone but Bush 
We found earlier this month that voters think 54/40 that Benghazi Committee is really just about hurting Clinton: 
LOLGOP actually just put a q on poll asking head to head which of those entities people like better...great minds... 
Here's a Republican legislative leader in North Carolina sort of reinforcing our poll findings today 
StopBigMoney If you e-mail us the questions you want asked we'll be glad to do it, omjpublicpolicypolling.com 
Taking question suggestions for a national poll this weekend: 
GregHarris71 It's too early for the general election polling at this point to be very predictive 
People keep asking why we don't ask Dem voters the Islamophobia questions. It's because that doesn't seem to be an issue in the Dem race 
armandodkos normal for NC- lower than a lot of other southern states- black more than half in SC, GA, AL, MS, LA, etc 
Thanks for your feedback 
Biden does 7 pts better than Clinton versus GOP in NC. Leads Bush by 5, ties Trump, down 1 to Fiorina, 3 to Carson: 
armandodkos They're about 1/3rd of Dem electorate in NC 
Huckabee and Fiorina lead Clinton by 7 in NC, Bush and Trump lead her by 5, Kasich by 4, Cruz by 3: 
GOP field leads Clinton in North Carolina. Strongest are Carson (51/41) and Rubio (50/40) who each lead her by 10: 
Clinton 31, Biden 26, Sanders 23 with white Dems in NC. But with black voters Clinton 47, Biden 34, Sanders 8: 
Biden's strength in NC attributable to conservative Dems- 20 of primary electorate and he gets 40 to 14 Clinton: 
Among Biden voters in NC, 46 say Clinton would be 2nd choice, 21 Sanders. Clinton leads Sanders 51/23 w/o Biden: 
Democrats in North Carolina- Clinton 37, Biden 30, Sanders 17, Webb 3, Chafee 2, O'Malley 1: 
You see the attitudes toward Islam with NC Republicans, you see why this stuff isn't hurting Trump and Carson in primary polling 
72 of GOP voters in NC agree with Trump sentiment that Obama is waging a 'war on Christianity,' only 20 disagree: 
72 of Republicans in NC say a Muslim should not be allowed to serve as President, only 16 ok w/ that possibility: 
Overall GOP voters in NC evenly split on whether practice of Islam should even be allowed- 40 say yes, 40 say no: 
52 of Trump's supporters in North Carolina think Islam should be illegal, only 31 think it should be allowed: 
Rand Paul's steady decline in North Carolina- 12 in June, 7 in July, 3 in August, now 0: 
Big problem for Bush in NC- GOP voters don't even like him. 34/47 fav, and it's 25/55 with 'very conservative' 
Jeb Bush led North Carolina in June. Was in 3rd place at 13 last month. Now in 7th place at 5: 
Rubio is second most popular GOPer in NC- 63/19 favorability- also second most frequent second choice at 15: 
Carson's 70/17 favorability makes him easily most popular GOPer in NC, also most frequent second choice at 16: 
Candidates with momentum in NC compared to six weeks ago- Carson (+7 from 14 to 21), Fiorina (+6 from 6 to 12): 
In NC/IA post-debate we've found Trump  mid-August  Possible he peaked earlier this month and on way down, but not compared to 6 wks ago 
Trump's 26 in NC and 53/36 fav actually a little better than 24 and 47/40 he had in mid-August: 
The bottom tier for the GOP in NC- Jindal/Santorum at 1, Gilmore, Graham, Pataki, and PAUL all round down to 0: 
Our new NC poll- Trump 26, Carson 21, Fiorina 12, Rubio 10, Cruz 9, Huckabee 6, Bush 5, Kasich 4, Christie 2: 
Paul is at 0 in the NC poll we're releasing tomorrow 
Trump is actually losing 'very conservative' voters in NC to Carson now but leads overall because of his strong support from moderates.... 
Lindsey Graham have 2 supporters in North Carolina this month, up from 0 last month  
Jeb Bush has dropped from 13 to 5 in North Carolina in the last month 
Trump was at 24 in North Carolina on our poll that came out of the field August 16th, 26 on one that wrapped up September 27th 
In May we found McCain leading Schweikert only 40/39 in a hypothetical primary contest 
JustinOArnold We have not

By 48/35 margin voters say theyd be less likely to vote for Reps who vote to defund PP and shut down govt: 
Our poll for PPRockyMountain finds majorities of CO voters oppose defunding Planned Parenthood, govt shutdown: 
modestholdings Q49: 
Here's everything left over from our Iowa poll earlier this week: 
Boehner's approval on our last national poll- 16/68. 26/58 even with Republicans: 
On the first night of our NC poll we asked GOP voters if they wanted Boehner to stay or go- 26 wanted him to stay, 60 wanted him to go 
TeresaKopec BillKristol BuzzFeedAndrew We're not doing the NH one 
We found Mitt Romney would poll at only 7 in Iowa this last weekend, well behind Trump/Carson/Fiorina. 
And in a 1 on 1 Presidential race- Rubio leads Trump 53/38 h2h in iowa 
Overall just a massive change from when we last polled LA a year ago in how voters view Vitter, Governor's race: 
Vitter has a 28/54 favorability rating with women, and trails Edwards 57/30 with them: 
Dardenne leads Edwards 42/40 in possible runoff, Angelle ties at 40. Both much stronger than Vitter in h2h: 
Vitter so badly damaged with Republicans right now, 28 say they would vote for Edwards over him in a runoff: 
Vitter trails John Bel Edwards 50/38 in possible runoff election. Last September Vitter led same match up 50/32: 
Standings for LA-Gov primary: Edwards 28, Vitter 27, Angelle 15, Dardenne 14: 
Even among Republicans Vitter's favorability is only 46/44 now. 30/52 with independents, 24/58 with Dems: 
Our new LA poll for Gumbo PAC finds that David Vitter has become quite unpopular- a 34/51 favorability rating: 
Elon Poll finds McCrory approval at 40/42, Burr at 29/37. Similar to High Point yesterday- voters not in love with either incumbent 
kcs_tarheel the people who are unhappy with our local politicians, it's due to unrest over the still nonexistent Olive Garden 
Light rail project remains overwhelmingly popular w/ Chapel Hill voters. Full results here: 
Kleinschmidt 37, Hemminger 25, Kahn 5. 33 undecided. Full results here: 
David_Laxton43 it's all about getting better as the season moves along 
New High Point poll finds Pat McCrory at 38/44 approval, Richard Burr at 26/40 approval. Relatively consistent with what we've been finding 
Taking North Carolina question suggestions for this weekend: 
seannnnnnnnnnnn he was included but polled at 0 
Kasich definitely doesn't seem to be getting much traction beyond New Hampshire 
emmajconeroddy No, I was surprised by the numbers too. She could be doing better the last few weeks, or it could always be an outlier 
Smart take 
Clinton up 49/15 with seniors, 48/19 with women in IA but just 33/32 with younger voters, 36/28 with men: 
Sanders leads Clinton 49/33 w/ 'very liberal' in Iowa, but she's up 56/16 w/ 'somewhat liberal,' 38/16 w/ moderates: 
Reallocate Biden voters to 2nd choice in IA and Clinton leads Sanders 50/25, almost identical to 52/25 early August: 
Among Biden voters in Iowa 43 say Clinton would be their second choice, just 15 that Sanders would be: 
Democratic field in Iowa: Clinton 43, Sanders 22, Biden 17, O'Malley/Webb 3, Chafee 2: 
Another sign of Bush's weakness- only Republican to trail Trump head to head in Iowa, 48/36: 
Former Scott Walker voters support anyone but Trump h2h- Carson 68/26, Rubio 66/31, Fiorina 59/28, even Bush 48/36: 
One bad thing for Trump in Iowa- trails Carson 60/33, Fiorina 54/36, Rubio 53/38, and trailed Walker 51/37 in h2h's: 
Images may be improving but Paul (4 now, 3 last month), Christie (1 both months) aren't seeing gain in support: 
Paul and Christie both have 43/32 favorabilities now in IA. Net 25 pt gain for Paul, 21 for Christie in last month: 
JINDALMENTUM! 56/19 favorability in IA makes him 5th most popular GOP hopeful. 4 standing puts him in top 10 there: 
DanaHoule  
Bush has a 38/40 favorability with Iowa Republicans, including 29/45 with 'very conservative' ones: 
Jeb Bush had biggest fall other than Walker in IA over last six weeks- from 11 to 6, putting him in a tie for 6th: 
Hypothetical Iowa field including Romney- Trump 24, Carson 17, Fiorina 14, Cruz 10, Romney/Rubio 7, Bush/Huckabee 6: 
Mitt Romney's not going to be the GOP's savior- only 7 of Iowa Republicans say they would support him if he was in: 
As Fiorina rises, GOP voters unsure what to make of record at HP- 42 say she did a good job, 12 bad, 46 not sure: 
Carly Fiorina is most frequent 2nd choice of GOP voters in IA at 16. 62/15 favorability best other than Carson: 
Ben Carson has 77/11 favorability w/ IA GOP, 15 pts better than next highest candidate. Support up from 12 to 17: 
What IA GOPers DID have a problem with Trump saying- 59 thought comments about Fiorina's appearance inappropriate: 
69 of IA Republicans agree with Trump premise that Obama is waging a war on Christianity, only 17 disagree: 
Among Trump voters in Iowa, 36 think Islam should be illegal, 26 aren't sure, just 38 think it should be allowed: 
Only 49 of Iowa Republicans even think Islam should be legal in the US. 30 say it shouldn't be, 21 not sure: 
2nd tier of Republicans in Iowa- Kasich 2, Christie/Santorum 1, Gilmore/Graham/Pataki all less than 1: 
Our new Iowa poll- Trump 24, Carson 17, Fiorina 13, Cruz/Rubio 8, Bush/Huckabee 6, Walker 5, Jindal/Paul 4: 
dancingbeanbob sorry about that  maybe you will get called for a national poll sometime! 
(Also I guess once is the new repeatedly) 
Asking who you support for Governor seems like kind of a low bar to achieve 'scum of the earth' status 
We will actually have some numbers tomorrow on Mitt in Iowa if he jumped in  
Amazingly precipitous decline, especially without some major scandal or gaffe 
ThePlumLineGS tonight/tomorrow 
We found Hillary doing a lot better in Iowa over the weekend than other recent polling had suggested as well 
bepryor ok here's the deal would also have been appropriate 
We've found 68 of GOP voters in NC say they would not be open to voting for a Muslim for any office, so doubt Carson comments hurt him 
Huckabee is actually winning, but is being held down by a gay liberal pollster conspiracy 
Huckabee's high profile gay bashing over the last few weeks got him all the way to 3 in our recent FL and SC polls 
PalmettoProgres my family's been staying in Greenville County for about the last 240 years haha 
BenjySarlin downtown Greenville is always perfect 
RGC_BPPA Maybe we'll open it up more next time. Sure FAMU and BCU have more fans than FIU at the very least! 
And with that have a good weekend, after Wednesday night and last night's follow up I think we all earned it 
VERY IMPORTANT POLL: only 23 of FL voters think Trump wears a toupee, 51 think his hair is real, 26 aren't sure: 
RGC_BPPA Was just doing FBS schools 
NFL loyalties in FL- Dolphins 19, Bucs 15, Jaguars 9, Giants 8, Cowboys 7, Packers/Patriots 6: 
lpackard 83 of D's, 59 of I's, 52 of R's say at least somewhat serious concerns 
Always appreciate the smart takes 
Baseball loyalties in FL- Braves/Rays 14, Yankees/Marlins 11, Red Sox 9, Cubs/Mets 5, Phillies 3: 
Only 25 of FL voters say Rays or Marlins are their favorite baseball team, 47 pick an out of state team: 
College sports loyalties in FL- Florida 23, Florida State 18, Miami 11, UCF 10, South Florida/FAU 5, FIU 2: 
Even among Republicans in Florida 71 say gay marriage being legal has proven to be no big deal: 
76 of Floridians say gay marriage being legal has had positive/no impact on their lives, only 24 claim negative: 
FL voters have greater sense of urgency on climate change than Rubio- 63 support EPA Clean Power Plan, 29 opposed: 
92 of Democrats, 88 of Republicans, 82 of independents in Florida support background checks on all gun sales: 
Background checks on all gun purchases continue to be very popular everywhere- 88 support, 7 opposition in FL: 
52 of Republicans in FL want minimum wage up to at least $10 an hour- base out in front of Presidential candidates: 
73 of FL voters support increasing minimum wage to at least $10. 13 say keep it at 7.25, 13 say get rid of it: 
63/31 support for Medicaid Expansion in Florida- we've consistently found strong support for it there: 
What  of Iowa GOP voters do you think will agree Obama is waging a war on Christians on our poll this weekend 
fbihop Yep those are the options we'll give 
fbihop We'll try it. I actually think people will probably get that one right though haha 
Obamacare just not the winning issue it used to be for GOP either. No longer unpopular in swing states 
Still some time to get in question suggestions for our post debate Iowa poll: 
NatetheBRD oops haha. 31 
We found last week that there's 62/31 support for the EPA Clean Power Plan...in South Carolina! Very popular even in red states 
baseballot Dbacks 
I am sitting at a baseball game and eating this 18 inch corn dog and I am happy with my life choices 
Fiorina was already surging in favorability- 53/23 on last national poll behind only Carson/Trump. Momentum growing 
Trump leads Bush 55/38 in a head to head in Florida 
He DID poll at 0 on our Florida poll last weekend 
crampell q24: 
68 of Louisianans don't think Jindal should be running for President 
We found nationally last week that even GOP primary voters support going up to at least 10 dollars an hour 
Fiorina really was a complete blank slate to GOP voters, whereas Graham already has quite negative favorability 
We've found a majority of Republican voters don't even know who Anthony Kennedy is, much less hate him. Such inside baseball 
emptywheel Pre court win 
So last month :) We found Brady had a 73/14 favorability rating with New Hampshire Republicans 
Nelson keeps a lower profile than Scott- has similar approval number but disapproval 11 points lower: 
Bill Nelson would still lead Scott 46/42 in a hypothetical 2016 Senate showdown though: 
FL voters closely divided on Rick Scott- 43 approve, 45 disapprove- about best numbers we've ever found for him: 
Young voters in FL support medical marijuana 75/18 while seniors least supportive- 53/40- more a when than if issue: 
Democrats in FL (78/15) overwhelmingly support medical marijuana initiative, Republicans (47/44) do too narrowly: 
Prospects for medical marijuana in Florida in a Presidential year look good- 63 support it, 29 opposed: 
If Rubio pivots to a reelection bid he'd be in decent shape- would lead Murphy 46/40, Grayson 48/38: 
GOP candidates in FL do better v. Grayson- Jolly leads him 39/36, DeSantis 37/36. Lopez-Cantera trails 41/34 though: 
Patrick Murphy modestly leads GOP field in FL-Sen- 40/35 over DeSantis and Jolly, 41/35 over Lopez-Cantera: 
Dem candidates in FL-Sen not that well known either- Murphy has 48 name rec, even Grayson just 55: 
39 undecided in Dem Senate primary in FL. Grayson 33, Murphy 27 thanks to 44-21 lead with 'very liberal' voters: 
All the GOP Senate candidates in FL have low name recognition- 37 for Jolly and DeSantis, 31 for Lopez-Cantera: 
52 of GOP voters undecided in FL-Sen and it's a muddle- Jolly 18, DeSantis 15, Lopez-Cantera 14: 
Undecided leads both the Republican and Democratic Senate races in Florida: 
I can't even 
David_Laxton43 not even a month in and we're already on day whatever? 
orangepolitics insightful 
We are happy to remove your number but I'm a little confused by this tattling to the RNC thing 
JM_Vasilj 
We found a couple yrs ago that Kwanzaa had a 29/48 favorability w/GOP voters so I guess he's with the base on this 
Taking Iowa question suggestions for this weekend: 
Clinton does lead Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee both 45/43 to round out the Florida match ups: 
Other Republicans who lead Clinton in Florida- Fiorina up 46/41, Kasich up 44/41, Walker up 45/43: 
Trump leads Clinton 48/42 in FL. Actually does slightly better against her than Rubio (48/43) and Bush (45/42): 
Strongest Republican for general election in Florida is Ben Carson- leads Clinton 49/40 and Sanders 48/33 there: 
More evidence Biden would mostly hurt Clinton- in FL 54 of his voters say Clinton would be 2nd choice, 14 Sanders: 
Compared to March in FL: Clinton -3, Biden +3, Sanders +15. 37 pt lead still shows strength for her in South though: 
Democratic side in Florida: Clinton 55, Sanders 18, Biden 17, O'Malley 2, Chafee/Webb 1: 
Trump's winning everyone in FL- 34 w/seniors, 30 w/men, 27 w/very conservative, 27 w/women, 26 w/moderates: 
FL continues long string of states where we find both Christie (38/48) and Paul (27/48) under water w/GOP voters: 
Florida another place where Carson is most frequent 2nd choice of GOP voters- 16 to 11 for Trump, 10 Rubio: 
Most popular candidates with FL GOP beyond Rubio- Carson at 72/13, Fiorina at 63/14, Cruz at 56/24, Trump at 56/35: 
Better news for Rubio than Bush- 73/20 fav makes him most popular candidate in FL, leads Trump 49/46 head to head: 
Bush so weak in FL he even trails Trump 55/38 in a head to head. Was in 1st place at 25 in March, now 3rd at 13: 
Seconded 
alexburnsNYT what are you talking about 
2nd tier in Florida- Huckabee 3, Christie/Walker 2, Jindal/Santorum 1, Gilmore/Graham/Pataki/Paul(!) all under 1: 
GOP standings in Florida: Trump 28, Carson 17, Bush 13, Rubio 10, Cruz 9, Fiorina 7, Kasich 5. No one else over 3: 
48 of voters in Florida think Rubio should drop out, only 42 believe he should continue his campaign: 
47 of voters in Florida think Bush should drop out, only 40 believe he should continue his campaign: 
A plurality of FL voters think both Bush and Rubio should drop out of the race. Polling at 3rd, 4th in GOP field: 
Pretty cool name 
One lonely soul in Florida still says Rick Perry is their second choice for the Republican nomination (poll was already in field) 
dwallbank AaronBlakeWP It was during the period where it wasn't clear who either side's Senate candidates would be so we had some fun 
Clear message from voters- Gowdy and Bush should play by same rules GOP leaders want Clinton to play by: 
Majority of voters think Bush is playing politics by attacking Clinton for e-mail practices similar to his own: 
54 of voters think Jeb Bush should turn over his e-mail server from his time as Governor of FL to state officials: 
In general only 20 of voters think members of Congress should be able to keep work related e-mails secret: 
The Republican base (58/35) and independents (53/33) join Democrats in thinking Gowdy needs to release his e-mails: 
56 think Gowdy is employing double standard by refusing to release his e-mail while demanding Clinton release hers: 
62 of voters think Gowdy should release his e-mails related to investigation, only 27 don't think he should: 
54 of voters think Gowdy investigation is mostly about hurting Hillary Clinton, only 40 that it's about Benghazi: 
Our new national poll finds voters think Trey Gowdy and Jeb Bush should release their e-mails: 
In South Carolina last week we found 49 of Biden supporters would otherwise be for Clinton, only 12 Sanders 
TurnerWalston we have all been yearning to see Shammond and Dexter in the same backcourt once again 
44 of GOP primary voters- 59 of Trump's- have a problem with candidates speaking Spanish, 40 think it's ok 
These findings, especially about Trump voters, pretty much reinforce what we found last week 
Kind of wild that this has ceased to really be newsworthy, but Trump/Carson just destroying Bush/Rubio on our FLORIDA poll this weekend 
Welp that's it for him 
This week in 2011 Rick Perry led Mitt Romney 31-18 on our national poll 
DKElections For you, nothing 
African American sample size in SC is more robust than most places, so interesting to note and keep an eye on 
Kanye has 22/44 favorability with Dem voters in SC, 5/64 with GOP. Maybe he should just run on the Kanye Party line: 
Kanye gets 5 as an independent candidate in SC to 50 Trump, 38 Clinton. Deez Nuts were polling higher than that: 
Donald Trump leads Hillary Clinton 50/39 in SC, pretty much in line with the margin Romney won the state by: 
Lindsey Graham actually trails Hillary Clinton 39/38 in SC, even as most Republicans lead her by double digits: 
SC another state where Ben Carson polls the strongest of any Republican in the general, leading Clinton 54/36: 
Here are the general election numbers from our South Carolina Presidential poll: 
54 of undecideds in our poll were Dems though compared to 9 GOP, suggesting a bigger Barry win if they turned out 
Bulldog_Being Just among GOP primary voters- Alabama 58 Auburn 28- pg. 3 
The party divide on preferred SC coastal destinations- Dems for Myrtle Beach 50/26, GOPers for Charleston 44/33: 
Myrtle Beach edges out Charleston 38/37 as preferred coastal destination of SC voters, Hilton Head lags at 15: 
South Carolina 45 Clemson 27. The breakdown of fan loyalty in the state. Maybe a 2009-2013 football score too? 
86 support in SC for more investment in fixing state roads- 51/37 support for allowing casinos, using that revenue: 
62/31 support for the EPA's Clean Power Plan in SC- really shows how broad favor for it is even in red states: 
62 support for Medicaid Expansion in South Carolina, 28 opposed. 85 with D's, 46/42 support even from GOP voters: 
71 of SC voters want minimum wage increased to at least $10 an hour- 89 of Dems, 65 of indys, 61 of GOP voters:

89 of S. Carolina voters support background checks on all gun purchases, 7 opposed. 91 GOP, 90 D's, 85 indys: 
Haley pretty popular but still only 22 want her as GOP VP candidate next year, 60 against idea. 28/52 with GOP: 
Haley drop with GOP, gain with Dems likely due to flag issue. GOP still wants to fly it 49/39, Dems against 12/77: 
Post flag debate Haley approval has improved from 17/71 to 39/45 w/ Dems, but dropped from 76/15 to 67/25 w/GOP: 
Nikki Haley has 53/35 approval, similar to 51/38 in February. But big underlying shifts- way up w/ Dems, down w/GOP: 
31 pt shift on Confederate flag in SC since February- just 33 support flying it, 54 opposed. Was 50/40 support: 
Still some time to get in Florida question suggestions for this weekend: 
Our new national polling finds that Tom Brady is guilty with the public anyway 
78 of South Carolina Republicans think Graham should drop out 
Taking Florida question suggestions for this weekend: 
The groups Clinton falls short of 50 with in South Carolina- whites (48), moderates (46), younger voters (41): 
In SC Clinton's at 64 with 'very liberal' voters, 59 with blacks, 57 with men, 56 with seniors, 52 with women: 
yeselson That's about right nationally but over 50 in SC 
Take Biden out of the mix in SC and Clinton would lead Sanders by 54 points at 66/12: 
Among Biden voters in SC, 49 say Clinton is 2nd choice, just 12 Sanders- he would hurt her much more than him: 
Sanders' 9 in SC worst we've found for him anywhere lately- he's at 3 with black voters who are majority of Dems: 
Democratic side in South Carolina- Clinton 54, Biden 24, Sanders 9, O'Malley/Webb 2, Chafee 1: 
Chris Christie has dropped from 7 to 1 in South Carolina since February, and has a 28/55 favorability: 
Rand Paul with a 28/52 fav in SC continues trend of being under water with GOP voters everywhere since debate: 
Folks with strong fav numbers in SC who might do better later- Huckabee (55/30), Fiorina (54/22), Rubio (53/29): 
Scott Walker's dropped from 18 to 3 in SC since February. 21 support wall on Canadian border, 60 opposed: 
Jeb Bush now has a 33/52 fav with SC Republicans- 26/64 with 'very conservative' ones- Christie-like numbers: 
BTW while only 26 of SC GOP voters think President Obama was born in the United States, 40 think Ted Cruz was: 
Ben Carson is most popular GOP candidate in SC- 74/14 fav. Edges Trump 46/45 h2h. Most frequent 2nd choice (18): 
Overall w/ SC GOP voters- 60 say Obama is a Muslim, 12 a Christian. 26 think Obama was born in US, 50 he wasn't: 
59 of Trump voters think it's inappropriate for Presidential candidates to speak Spanish to Hispanic audiences: 
Trump voters in SC: 69 say Obama's a Muslim, only 22 think he was born in US, 64 mad about Mt. McKinley renaming: 
In SC Trump leads Rubio 58/35, Fiorina 56/32, Walker 59/31, Bush 66/27, and Graham 72/20 in head to heads: 
Trump's 64/28 fav with GOP voters in SC is the best we've found for him anywhere so far. Only Carson better there: 
Trump winning everyone in SC- 47 w/ moderates, 40 men, 39 Evangelicals, 36 seniors, 36 young voters, 34 women: 
Bottom of the barrel of the GOP field in SC- Santorum at 2, Christie, Jindal, and Perry at 1, Gilmore/Pataki lt;1: 
GOP field in SC- Trump 37, Carson 21, Bush/Cruz 6, Fiorina/Kasich/Rubio 4, Graham/Huckabee/Paul/Walker 3: 
This might be realDonaldTrump 's favorite poll finding yet- SC GOPers prefer him 72/20 over Graham head to head: 
The Presidential bid is hurting Graham's image in SC- 54/29 approval with GOP primary voters in February, now 36/51: 
Our new South Carolina poll finds 78 of Republican primary voters there think Lindsey Graham should drop out: 
We had Ayotte +1 last week- shaping up to be a very competitive race 
Undecideds are mostly Democratic and heavily African American, strong groups for Barry. But will they turn out? 
jamesleegilbert at bottom of this: being very bad and tweeting at you from 85 on the way down! 
The mentions after getting mentioned by Dr. Carson are never boring 
We're not doing anything to encourage that lady 
 
Numbers in this poll are very similar to our national picture earlier in the week 
Polling joke candidates has been fun, but we're going to take a break now and stick to serious people like Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Kanye 
Rounding out joke candidate primary are Queen Elsa Ice at 4, Butt Stuff at 3, Cranky Pants at 2, Limberbutt McCubbins/ 'Murican Cookies at 1 
Finally we did an FEC filed joke candidate primary- top tier is Captain Crunch 17, Deez Nuts 9, Beast Mode 5: 
The rest of the Republican against Clinton- Cruz down 5 (47/42), Kasich down 5 (44/39), Rubio down 4 (47/43): 
Against Bush: Clinton +4, Biden +3, Sanders -1. Against Trump: Clinton +2, Biden +6, Sanders -1: 
Republicans who do the worst against Clinton- Walker down 7 at 47/40, Huckabee down 6 at 48/42: 
Trump as hypothetical independent candidate trailed Bush only 46/44 with GOP voters, got 31 of I's to Bush's 19: 
Good news for GOP if Trump signs loyalty pledge. Gets 27 as independent, beating Bush's 23. Clinton at 42 up big: 
Trump is now doing better against Democrats than the 'electable' trio of Bush/Rubio/Walker: 
Fiorina (45/43) and Trump (46/44) both trail Clinton by just 2 nationally. Trump doing better in general now too: 
The only 2 people with positive ratings w/ overall electorate in our national poll- Carson at 41/30, Biden at 43/40: 
Ben Carson's the strongest GOPer in the general in our new national poll- ties Clinton at 44, leads Sanders 42/36: 
Ok we found something that emerged with its reputation relatively intact after a fight with Donald Trump- Oreos have a 54/17 favorability 
jameshohmann I was there last weekend and overdid the unlimited milk and got an upset stomach :) 
Still some time to get in South Carolina question suggestions for this weekend: 
Aligns closely with our national numbers on birthright citizenship over weekend. IA Poll had similar birther  too 
BTW Lindsey Graham's comments last week were the impetus for our look at the beliefs of Trump supporters this week: 
We are devastated by Bill Kristol's criticism. Going to be hard to carry on today 
49 of GOP primary voters on our new national poll said they wanted an increase to at least $10 an hour 
I really hope this is just trolling 
Good to know Hillary was being kept informed on our polls 
Another smart take 
LOL 
Taking question suggestions for a South Carolina poll this weekend: 
29 think the President was born in the United States, 40 think Ted Cruz was 
matthewjdowd thanks for the kind words- and I agree that by the totality of the polling it would be a travesty for her not to be main stage 
matthewjdowd Think that's smart- she may be able to succeed with it in a way others can't 
matthewjdowd missed that one honestly! Guess it didn't get as much attention as the others 
Popular view with NH GOP voters- Brady has 73/14 favorability with them and 76 think he has been wronged by the NFL 
Had a nice discussion this morning about polling on the Presidential race and William McKinley with SenatorBegich guest hosting on KOAN 
On whole, national Dem numbers suggest IA/NH kind of on their own plane while most of party still strongly Hillary: 
Still up big but Clinton's favorability numbers with Dem primary voters are at new low- 63/26. Sanders up to 49/21: 
Groups where Clinton's support is lowest- 47 with moderates, 48 with younger voters, 49 with men, 52 with whites: 
Strongest groups for Clinton- 65 with African Americans and 'very liberal' voters, 59 with women, 56 with seniors: 
Democratic side- Clinton 55, Sanders 20, O'Malley 4, Webb 3, Chafee/Lessig 1. Clinton was up 57/22 last month: 
And 49 of this super conservative GOP base wants to increase the minimum wage to at least $10 an hour: 
So as conservative as this GOP base is- 78 support background checks on all gun purchases, only 14 opposed: 
Chris Christie's at 2 with a 28/54 favorability. The Paul/Christie duel was one where both combatants got killed: 
Hard to deny based on all these numbers that GOP figures who have picked fights with Trump haven't suffered from it: 
Rand Paul had a 42/30 favorability with GOP voters before the debate. Now 29/50, and only polling at 1: 
Scott Walker's dropped from 2nd place and 17 nationally in July to now a tie for 8th place at 5: 
GOP candidates with momentum besides Trump/Carson- Fiorina has gone from 4 to 8, Kasich from 3 to 6 nationally: 
Ben Carson is most popular GOP candidate with 68/14 favorability. Top 2nd choice- beats Trump head to head 49/43: 
Fox News isn't hurting from the Trump feud though. 66 of GOP voters have favorable opinion, similar to 6 months ago: 
More evidence Trump won the Megyn Kelly fight. Her fav with GOP has gone from 44/9 to 42/20. His from 48/39 to 56/30: 
Jeb Bush has a negative favorability rating with GOP voters nationally- 39/42. 33/48 with very conservative voters: 
Overall 54 of GOP voters think Obama is a Muslim, only 29 think he was born in US. Explains struggle of centrists: 
ArgoJournal You inspired us to do so 
Supporters of every GOP candidate except Christie/Kasich/Bush more likely to think Obama is Muslim than Christian: 
Supporters of every GOP candidate except Kasich, Bush, Christie, and Rubio think Obama was born outside the US: 
63 of Trump voters, 51 of GOP voters overall want to eliminate birthright citizenship: 
29 of GOP primary voters think Barack Obama was born in the United States. 40 think Ted Cruz was: 
Who are Trump's supporters? 66 think Obama is a Muslim, 61 think he was born outside US: 
2nd tier of GOP field- Christie/Santorum 2, Gilmore/Paul/Perry 1, Graham/Jindal/Pataki lt;1: 
Our new national GOP poll- Trump 29, Carson 15, Bush 9, Fiorina 8, Rubio 7, Cruz/Kasich 6, Huckabee/Walker 5: 
smart take 
Hillary was up 35 on our national poll last month and she's up 35 on our national poll this month- IA/NH really on their own track 
Yes y'all we can poll on Kanye (also why are you watching this?h 
When we did a big poll on Presidents a few years ago William McKinley had a 17/13 favorability rating with more than 70 having no opinion 
ActorAaronBooth presentation at the DNC meeting 
There is a like 12 yo sitting behind me at the Twins game talking about Deez Nuts. Have never felt so dubiously influential 
laurenhovis better than going along the wrong way without asking! 
Just got a long VM from some old white lady saying we need to give 'Negro' as a response option on the race q instead of 'African American' 
Lady angry about a poll she got called for drops at the end of the message that she knows a lot about polling because she has an MBA 
New Republican poll finds Pat McCrory trailing Roy Cooper, wonder if RRR will respond? 
_Choo__Choo_ Very cool. I love your girls and hope their year is off to a good start! 
 
FWIW (very little!) we polled on Donald Trump's hair nationally last month and found it had a 12/49 favorability rating 
57 of NH voters think public education funding needs to be increased, 47 think teachers are under paid: 
60 of NH voters support policy to produce 50 of America's energy needs from renewable sources by 2030, 25 against: 
NFL loyalties in New Hampshire- 66 Patriots, 5 Packers/Giants, 3 Cowboys. MLB- 69 Red Sox, 7 Yankees, 4 Braves: 
Tom Brady has 68/16 favorability in NH. 66 think he has been treated unfairly by NFL. Next big 2016 issue no doubt: 
While Scott Brown's favorability numbers are in the tank, Jeanne Shaheen doing quite well- 50/39 approval: 
Scott Brown is very unpopular in NH- 29/50 favorability. Has dropped from 77/16 to 48/27 with R's since election: 
71 of NH voters support increasing minimum wage to at least $10 an hour- 92 of D's, 72 of i's, 52 of GOP support: 
85 support for background checks on all gun purchases in New Hampshire. 96 from D's, 82 from I's, 79 R's: 
Big reason for narrowly positive ACA numbers in NH- Ds now more unified in support (79) than Rs (74) in opposition: 
We're finding public opinion pretty evenly divided on Obamacare in most places now, and trending towards support: 
NH voters narrowly support Affordable Care Act 44/43. Big change from when it used to be unpopular in swing states: 
Sununu and Bradley lead Terie Norelli/Chris Pappas/Colin Van Ostern by 4-7 pts in hypothetical  matches: 
If Hassan doesn't run, possible R candidates Sununu (71 name rec), Bradley (56) much better known than Ds (21-27): 
If Maggie Hassan ran for reelection she would lead Chris Sununu by 7 and Jeb Bradley by 9 in hypothetical matches: 
EricKleefeld nickmartin those 3 are all actual registered candidates who have emailed in the last week asking to be included 
Finally Deez Nuts gets 6 in NH, slightly less than his previous 7-9 in MN, IA, and NC. 6/11 favorability: 
Tested as an independent in NH, Trump gets 41 of Republicans, 30 of independents, 11 of Democrats: 
Here's how weak Bush is in NH- finished 3rd with 22 if Trump runs as indy. Clinton gets 43, Trump 28: 
Sanders does average of 3.5 pts better than Clinton in h2h's in NH. Leads Bush/Walker by 8, Trump by 9, Rubio by 13: 
Sanders has best overall favorability of all candidates in NH at 46/36. Kasich at 36/30, Carson 36/33 also positive: 
Clinton is up 7 or 8 points in New Hampshire against all of Bush, Christie, Rubio, Walker, and Carson: 
GOPers who do worst against Clinton in NH- Huckabee down 13 at 49/36, Cruz down 11 at 49/38, Paul down 10 at 47/37: 
GOPers who do best against Clinton in NH besides Kasich- she leads Trump by only 2 at 46/44, Fiorina by 3 at 45/42: 
Democrats lead 14 of 15 Presidential match ups in New Hampshire. Only exception- Kasich leads Clinton 43/41: 
Ayotte would lead Chris Pappas 45/31 in a head to head- Hassan may be only Dem who would start out close: 
All three times we've tested the Ayotte/Hassan match this year they've been within a point of each other: 
We continue to find that an Ayotte/Hassan match up would be a toss up- Ayotte 44, Hassan 43: 
EvanMcSan One time in Omaha they tried to give me a pick up truck 'because you're from North Carolina' I said no that's not going to work 
LOL. BTW Paul favorability with GOP voters since debate- 34/49 in NH, 31/47 in NC, 36/44 in MO, 31/45 in IA 
We found 86/8 support for them in Virginia when we polled there last month 
MaggiePatton94 just because your dog is cute doesn't mean you need to hate on all the ugly dogs 
Taking national poll question suggestions for this weekend: 
joschein tomorrow 
John Kasich easily the strongest Republican general election candidate in NH 
All the publicity is not helping the cause of Deez Nuts- only at 6 in New Hampshire, lowest performance yet 
New Hampshire somewhat of an island in Democratic race- Clinton up at least 18 everywhere else we've polled lately: 
Big Clinton/Sanders divide in NH is generational- Clinton up 51/34 with seniors, Sanders up 45/29 w/ everyone else: 
Not much ideological divide on D side in NH- Sanders up 13 w/ 'somewhat liberal,' 9 w/ 'very liberal,' 4 w/moderates: 
Bernie Sanders now almost universally popular with Dems in NH- 78/12 fav. Clinton at 63/25, down from 78/10 in April:

Besides Bush/Huckabee/Paul Graham (20/43), Christie (35/46), Pataki (27/32), Perry (34/37) under water on fav in NH: 
NH another state where Ben Carson is most well liked GOP candidate- 62/17 fav. Fiorina at 58/19, Trump at 56/32: 
Kasich's 2nd place in NH almost entirely based on 20 standing with moderates. Polls at 1 with 'very conservative':
