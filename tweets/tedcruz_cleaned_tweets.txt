Ive consistently stood up to both parties fighting for the people, and Ill do the same as President!  
For forty years, realDonaldTrump has been funding liberal democratic politicians.  
Falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie. And it's something realDonaldTrump does daily.  
John Kerrys foreign policy has been a disaster. Its why I voted against him. Donald Trump donated to him.

As president, I'll fight for a  of Obamacare

If Im elected president, on my first day I will rescind each and every one of President Obamas illegal executive actions  
One of the most important questions for 2016 is who is prepared and committed to fight for principled  Justices  
I think 2016 should be a referendum on the Supreme Court  
If Im elected, on my 1st day in office Ill instruct every federal agency that persecution of religious liberty ends today  
Religious liberty for me has been a lifelong passion. Ive spent the last two decades fighting to defend religious liberty  
On the questions of life and marriage, a record matters.  
We are seeing an assault on Judeo-Christian values and religious liberty. We need a president who will protect those values  
If I am elected president, we will NOT be drafting our daughters into combat  
I dont think the military should be governed by political correctness
