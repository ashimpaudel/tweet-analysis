"@OKnox certainly wasn't criticizing you specifically, but, yes, anonymity for sniping is the worst. just print the press release"
@OKnox  right. explanations are necessary when they aren't really justified or when important to highlight agenda of source to readers
@imtheMDP the only argument I really make against clinton is that one and it is indeed perplexing
"@OKnox somebody providing newsworthy info in opposition to a campaign which could derail their careers, not just ""concerns abt message"""
"@OKnox something whistleblowerish. ""campaign spending all money on consultants, according to source."" ""Candidate is drunk at 8 am."""
"@OKnox obscures who sources are, obscures their agendas, unclear whether it's basically a campaign press release, etc..."
"@OKnox ""you"" gotta write stories. I get it. but granting anonymity to ""aides"" for mostly pointless chatter doesn't inform readers 1/"
"@UOJim @ggreenwald he was granted anonymity, this must be really serious and important! is what most readers think"
@UOJim @ggreenwald right. that's the bit that reporters pretend not to understand too often. granting anonymity actually privileges a source
"@ggreenwald if they really are ""aides"" (and I admit, who knows) maybe STFU? just so weird"
"@ggreenwald in campaign journalism it's mostly just gossip. and information free gossip. ""aides worry..."" ""aides concerned..."""

"@mirandamuseum it'd be like boycotting borscht on russian revolution day. no one eats borscht ! (yes, people do, but it isn't a thing)"
"@mirandamuseum barely, but not the point.  assertion is that wwii generation boycotted japanese food on pearl harbor day. just absurd"
what if the darkest timeline was the right one
@on3ness of course japanese and japanese-america food existed in the us at certain times and certain places.
@on3ness great erick's parents have been telling him to boycott Japanese food  in DC 4 decades after WWII when he lived in dubai
the point is that it's of course stupid and racist. but also it's a total lie. he's a total liar. re-hire him CNN
even if there was (there wasn't) the idea that young Erick would notice ONE DAY that he couldn't eat teriyaki is ridiculous
"erick puts this on his parents. however much japanese food there was in 1987, there was no post-pearl harbor boycott japanese food mvment"
DADDY PLEASE GIVE ME UNAGI no son not until tomorrow. yes this was a converstation had in 1987
MY DADDY DIDN'T LET ME EAT RAMEN ON PEARL HARBOR DAY IN  1987 what the fuck are you talking about son
everybody lies and exaggerates a bit. we all suck. but  lying to foment racism is a bit disgusting tho
"maybe there was japanese food on every corner in Dubai in 1987. no idea. but this was not a thing for ""WWII Parents"""
"the idea that there was a ""boycott japanese food"" movement is absurd because there was (mostly) no japanese food movement in the US"
"@fred_burton15 read a bit of James recently. that was fun. still no ""lying for jesus or whatever"""
i admit i'm sorta dumb on this stuff. i remember Matthew a bit
"in which gospel was ""lie for jesus or really whatever you want"" spelled out"
@maura i know. people are rightly focused on the fact that it's racist. but it's also just a lie. jesus is proud
"@maura chinese, japanese, let's call the whole thing off"
"@pareene i highly doubt japanese food - even if it existed- was a big thing in dubai in 1987, but BOYCOTT SUSHI was never a thing in the US"
@pareene so the idea that this was something common for people from the US is absurd.
"@pareene sure, and I don't know the reality of dubai then, but his assertion was that this was a thing for the children of WWI"
(yes of course there was some japanese food. just not any that most people had access to)
but it was like ben carson's lie about the hoax makeup test. it did not make any sense. there was no japanese food in the US until later
i also don't argue with what people call themselves. if erick son of erick calls himself a christian he is. but funny flavor of christianity
"(i don't have any problem with religion, just hucksters who use it to promote themselves)"
could anyone do more damage to the brand of Christianity than erick son of erick. hilarious
