Marco Rubio's at only 4% in North Carolina among people who have actually already cast their ballots

And that same analysis also found Clinton leading Sanders 78-22 for next week's primary in Mississippi (4 of 5)
That same analysis also found Clinton leading Sanders 60-40 for next Tuesday's primary in Michigan (3 of 5)
That same analysis found Clinton leading Sanders 77-23 for Saturday's primary in Louisiana (2 of 5)
The analysis we did Saturday about where the Dem race stood with committed voters held up pretty well tonight except for Oklahoma...(1 of 5)

Looking beyond Tuesday- last week we found Clinton up 77/23 in Louisiana among voters whose minds were totally made up
"Point- Clinton's base is much more solidly committed to her than Sanders, and now that momentum has shifted to her that may become important"
In Oklahoma last week we found Clinton up 57/43 among voters whose minds were totally made up
In Massachusetts last week we found Clinton up 53/47 among voters whose minds were totally made up
In Virginia last week we found Clinton up 72/28 among voters whose minds were totally made up

In Alabama last week we found Clinton up 76/24 among voters whose minds were totally made up
In Texas last week we found Clinton up 69/31 among voters whose minds were totally made up

So I don't know if he was just really lonely or the long weather discussion was his form of revenge for calling and polling him (5 of ?)
But then he apologized for being so nasty and engaged me in a 15 minute discussion about the weather in Arkansas (4 of ?)
So I called him back today to tell him it was someone else that kept calling him. He said he was about to report us to the FBI (3 of ?)
So we immediately put him on our Do Not Call List. But then he called back Tuesday and Wednesday with similarly nasty vm's (2 of ?)
So this man called from Arkansas and left a very profane voicemail Monday night telling us not to call him ever again (1 of ?)
