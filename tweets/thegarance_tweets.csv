17) All of which is to explain why Clinton's comments today raised such ire.

15) Michael Bronksi on the Reagans https://t.co/HyVNXtbgaM https://t.co/6ygeMTHx6l
@Rod_Noir Anti-gay marriage ballot initiatives + Bush re-election campaign
14) Today we are all more visible to each other. Imagine 40K people in America dying in 21st c w/o president talking about it. Impossible.
"13) Today we talk endlessly on TV &amp; social about every minor controversial thing, but in '80s, 40K people died &amp; the president said nothing."
"12) So  view fr other side is a community of people SCOTUS said criminal, facing a fatal disease, unrepresented by any political party."
"11) Between AIDS panic and that ruling, homophobia in America ratcheted up in the late 80s. See: https://t.co/xXqVkGaETx"
"10) The old anti-gay laws were still on the books, upheld by Bowers v. Hardwick in 1986."
9) Or this 1987 Silence = Death Project poster https://t.co/QEIrAO9YwE
8) The view from the other side is encapsulated by contemporaneous imagery such as this Donald Moffett from 1987 https://t.co/d8crFuLcRj
"7) The Times headline was ""Heckler Stirs Clinton Anger"""
"6) When Bill Clinton famously said, ""I feel your pain,"" he said it to Bob Rafsky of ACT UP, who was heckling him. https://t.co/ahKCZjmbi4"
5) Gay people had no party on their side &amp; no one to represent or speak for them fr halls of power. ACT UP protested Democrats continually.
"4) What Clinton said perfectly encapsulated the viewpoint of mainstream Democrats in the 1980s, before the party became gay friendly"
"3) There was a mainstream, and then there were the margins. And the margins were much more distant from the center than they are today."
"2) Today all the different communities in America sit cheek by jowl on social &amp; online media. In the 80s, they were separated by vast chasms"
1) Belatedly: I don't doubt for a second that what Clinton said about the Reagans &amp; AIDS is how she remembers things being in in the 80s/90s
