Dont like Leap Days? We could instead wait 28 years and insert a Leap Week. Or 112 years and insert a Leap Month. 
TheKidKelch Andrew__Carter FYI: To most people, leap has usage connotation of getting ahead, rather than catching up. 
According to Gregorian rules, only 1 in 4 century years is a leap year  the rarity of 2000s leap day went largely unnoticed 
The Leap Day is misnamed. Were not leaping anywhere. The calendar is simply, and abruptly, catching up with Earths orbit 
Born on a leap day? Youve had 1/4 as many birthdays as the rest of us, but sorry, youre not 1/4th as old.

 NewHorizons2015 went 4-billion miles to buzzcut Pluto by 120,000 miles. A hole-in-one on a 2-mile golf shot. 
gedeon Youve invoked specious statistical reasoning, as detailed in The Pluto Files. Link to come shortly, if interested 
First rule of Science: Must Finish experiment before you die. NewHorizons2015 was launched fast. Reached Pluto in 9 years. 
 As reported in the NYTimes in 1930, when discovered, Pluto was presumed to be the size of Earth. 
 Pluto would fit comfortably between New York amp; Dallas. Between Rome amp; Moscow. Between Perth amp; Melbourne. 
 The moons Ganymede Titan Callisto Europa Io Titan amp; our Moon are all bigger than Pluto. Get over that one too.

 In 1979, Pluto crossed Neptunes orbit, and for 20 years was the eighth planet in the solar system. 
 Plutos primary moon Charon is so large that their mutual center-of-mass lies not within Pluto but in empty space 
 Ever since Pluto was discovered in 1930, it has completed barely 1/3 of its own 248 year orbit around the Sun. 
Another favorite Pluto song. The one that started them all. By Folk singer Christine Lavin.

For Algebra Geeks: If the thickness of a pizza is A, and its radius is Z, and pi is just PI, then its volume is V = PIZZA. 
In other words, if the crust of a 14-inch pizza is 1-inch wide, then the next 1-inch band occupies 30 of the topping's area. 
If the cheese on a 14-inch pizza falls just 1-inch shy of the crust, the pie is missing 30 of the cheese that could be there 
A 14-inch pizza is 154 square inches of food. Nearly twice as large as the 78 square inches of a 10-inch pie. 
Odd that pizza is sold by the inch, but consumed by the square-inch. This fact confuses assessment of pricing and toppings.

Got a bunch more Southern Hemisphere tidbits, but I think Ill save them for even later... 
So Alpha" Centauri is the brightest star in the constellation Centaurus. And Beta" Pictoris is the 2nd brightest in Pictor. 
Apart from common names, stars are generally ID'ed in order of brightness within a constellation, using the Greek alphabet. 
The Southern skies have the closest star system to the Sun - the famed Alpha Centauri The 3rd brightest in the night sky. 
Earth is closest to the Sun during the Southern Hemisphere Summer. For the North, that of course coincides with our winter. 
Many big telescope in the North have twins in the South, giving astrophysicists coherent full-sky coverage of the Universe. 
Just an FYI: Earths South Magnetic Pole is actually in the North. Thats why the North tip of a compass needle points there. 
The center of the Milky Way  a target of study for my PhD  passes directly overhead for all middle southern latitudes. 
Arctic" derives from Arktos, the Greek word for Bear. The Arctic's got em. (For now.) The Ant-Arctic doesn't.

Stompn_Tom: Last I checked Pittsburgh is in the Northern Hemisphere amp; has many free Penguins. // Human Penguins dont count. 
Sundials designed for the North won't work in the Southern Hemisphere. If ported there, they would reckon time backwards. 
In the North, the shadow of a sundials gnomon sweeps clockwise. Thats, in fact, what defined clockwise in the first place. 
Some of us in the North are jealous that 100 of the worlds population of free Penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere. 
arrowsails Yes. 
Earth is not only oblate  wider at the equator than pole-to-pole, but pear shaped  slightly wider just south of the equator 
Earth's centrifugal force at the Equator renders everybody and everything about 6 lighter than theyd weigh at the poles. 
At a revolution speed of 1,700 km / hour, the equator is Earths fastest moving part. All other latitudes move more slowly. 
I think it's cool that there's a country on the equator with the name "Equator". Better known in Spanish as Ecuador 
Antarcticas subglacial Lake Vostok is a body of water, trapped in ice, that hasnt seen air in at least 15-million years. 
The flag in Antarctica that ID's the South Pole has to be repositioned every year. The glacier beneath moves continuously. 
The South Pole is covered with land: Antarctica. In the North, Santas gotta live on an (ever-shrinking) slab of floating ice 
At about 2800 meters above sea level, the South Pole plateau sits at an elevation almost as high as that of Mount Olympus. 
Toilet Bowls drain however they're designed to circulate water. Its irrelevant whether you live above or below the equator.

Hmmm. I understand that some people want to call this eclipse the "Blood Moon. If its red, Ill be thinking of rose petals. 
Lunar Eclipses are visible from the entire Earth hemisphere facing the Moon. Thats billions amp; billions of people : - ) 
Those who don't know a Lunar Eclipse is in progress will likely mistake Earth's shadow for the Moon going through phases. 
At 3.5 hrs, Total Lunar Eclipses are long amp; boring. Wait for the Moon to enter the deepest part of Earth's shadow: 1:58am ET. 
Total Eclipses occur every couple of years or so. If anyone calls them "rare", ask if they feel that way about the Olympics. 
Dust in Earth's atmosphere can tint sunlight, casting eclipsed Moons in a deep red light. But often the Moon just gets dark. 
After midnight Monday ET, the Full Moon ambles deep into Earth's projected shadow in space: Behold a Total Lunar Eclipse. 
Attention StarGazers: Watch for the "Income Tax" Lunar Eclipse, beginning Mon night 12:53am ET (Tue Morning). Lasting 3.5 hrs 
FYI: Tonight's Moon, a waxing gibbous, is the same phase as that of Earth in this Apollo 8 NASA photo

Are you a Tide weenie? I wrote an essay called "The Tidal Force" some years ago: [2,000 words] 
Not only is Earth's rotation slowly slowing down, but the Moon's orbit is spiraling away from us by about 2-inches per year. 
And not to disturb anybody, but Tides cause friction between Earth's crust and the sloshing oceans, slowing down our rotation 
The Sun's tides are only about 1/3 that of the Moon's, so even during the canceling quarter phases, some Moon-tide remains. 
During half-moons (1st amp; 3rd quarter), the Lunar amp; Solar tides add out of phase, partly canceling one another. 
The tides during Full (and New) Moon are highest **only** because that's when the Sun's tides add directly to them. 
While we're on the subject: The Moon's capacity to raise tides on Earth is no greater when Full than at any other phase. 
Submitted without further comment. 
FYI:Moon's orbit around Earth is oval. Distance varies by about 10. When Moon is Full amp; "close", some call it the Super Moon 
The perennially hyped name "Super Moon" insults the legacy of Superman, Super Volcanoes, Supernovae, and even Super Mario. 
Okay to call tonight's Full Moon "super", but only if you would call a 13-inch pizza "super" compared with a 12-inch pizza.

Hmm. Were it up to Princeton Review covers, my daughter would've never taken AP Calculus or Physics 
In my asteroid-state-of-mind, I instead watched the 1998 film Deep Impact, where a Black president inherits a bad situation. 
Was ready to watch the 1998 film Armageddon (in which the laws of physics are optional) but it's nowhere on Netflix or iTunes 
One twentieth of one percent: The fraction of NASA's budget allocated to locating Killer Asteroids. 
One half of one percent: The fraction of the US Federal Budget allocated to all of NASA's activities. 
In the film Armageddon, a takeaway line was "No More Taxes!" But taxes are what funded the NASA mission that saved the world 
Of course in the 1998 film Armageddon, the asteroid chunks had awesome aim, hitting **all** the great cities of the world. 
If NASA never deflects  and it hits Earth one day, we'll confirm that humans possess a lethal absence of foresight. 
Finally, evidence for Hollywood that not all asteroids hit major cities of the United States. 
If Asteroid  ever made it through Earth's atmosphere, its crater would be larger than Monaco. 
We've known since the atom bombs over Hiroshima amp; Nagasaki, that air blasts can damage much wider areas than ground blasts. 
The day Asteroid  hits Earth it will likely explode in our atmosphere, with 1000x the power of Hiroshima atomic bomb

Yup. Asteroid "2012 DA14" has an orbit that crosses Earth's orbit. It will one day hit us, like the one in Russian last night 
Nope. Asteroid 2012DA14 won't redirect Earth's orbit any more than a gnat flying full speed ahead will topple a Bull Elephant 
Yup. Asteroid "2012 DA14" buzz-cuts Earth today at a distance 5,000 miles closer than our orbiting communication satellites. 
Yup. Asteroid "2012 DA14" is the size of a fifteen story office building.

A millennium ago, Baghdad scholars adopted Zero, completing the system of ArabicNumerals used worldover, except in SuperBowls

The bright "star" in the sky these nights is Jupiter. If you "wished upon" it at dusk, don't expect that wish to come true.

How many field goals in N/S stadiums flick the right upright's inside edge amp; bounce backwards? Blame them on Earth's rotation 
Coriolis force in N/S football stadiums always deflects field goals to the right: East for North kicks amp; West for South kicks 
Oops, dopplershift noted that my Coriolis deflection was computed for the S. Hemisphere, where they don't play Am.Football. 
dopplershift Indeed, to the right. For reasons that defy explanation, I did the calculation for the S. Hemisphere. Will correct. 
bigalrosario: Does neiltyson know these things? Or have to Google them? Either way I appreciate it. // I calculate them. 
The Coriolis force comes from Earth's rotation, and it's what deflects clouds from North-South movement into circular storms.

To all Christians of the world: "Merry Christmas." To Jews, Muslims, amp; everybody else not expecting Santa: "Happy Tuesday." 
Random Santa Fact: Another casualty of global warming -- as the poles melt, most would rather not see Santa in a bathing suit 
When Earth's oil runs out amp; price of other fuels rises then naughty children will thank Santa for giving them a lump-of-coal 
RandomSantaFact: Red-orange lights penetrate fog particles better than blue light. So Rudolph's nose is perfect for the task. 
Santa surely keeps track of how many hours pass amp; how long the Elf union allows them to work, but time of day has no meaning.

Dear MarsCuriosity, Neil deGrasse Tyson signing out on Earth. Back to work - for us both. Closing my Twitterverse wormhole to Mars. 
Dear MarsCuriosity, As for your complicated landing on Mars Sunday night 10:30pm PT -- do not try, do. 
Dear MarsCuriosity, We've got the  back here on Earth. But many of us will be focussed on you and your landing. Do us proud. 
Dear MarsCuriosity, What are your instructions if a Martian crawls onto your back and rides you like a Rodeo Bull? 
Dear MarsCuriosity, Bummer. You travel through space at seven miles per second, only to drive around on Mars at 1.5 inches per second. 
Dear MarsCuriosity, You're the size of an SUV, but with six wheels. What's the fastest that you can move? 
Dear MarsCuriosity, After you land on Mars, what's your life expectancy? (I hope somebody alerted you that we're not bringing you back.) 
Dear MarsCuriosity, Scientists conceived you, engineers designed you. But seriously, who do you like better, Scientists or Engineers? 
Dear MarsCuriosity, What's your favorite experiment that you will conduct on Mars?Or is that likepicking your favorite child? 
Dear MarsCuriosity, How autonomous are you? When you get to Mars can you just go six-wheeling around as you please? 
Dear MarsCuriosity, Did you enjoy long periods of silence while travelling through space, or was JPL always trying to talk toyou? 
Dear MarsCuriosity, So you're being subjected to ionizing radiation from space? You're not only a robot, you're a guinea pig. 
Dear MarsCuriosity, You've been traveling for nine months. How did you pass your time? Did they let you play "Angry Birds Space"? 
Dear MarsCuriosity, Wait a minute. You travelled a 100-million miles in space amp; hit an area 12x4 miles? Cool. Way better than a hole-in-one 
Dear MarsCuriosity, Are all your parts working as they should? Anything you're not telling us back here on Earth? (I won't tell JPL.) 
Dear MarsCuriosity, You call EDL 7-minutes of terror. Sure, to you. But to us on Earth, it's 7 minutes + 15 minutes signal time. 
Dear MarsCuriosity, What's the size of your landing spot on Mars? Is it small? It's a whole planet, I'd be happy just to land anywhere. 
Dear MarsCuriosity, just as I suspected. An element named after Pluto. Discovered when everyone thought the little iceball was a planet. 
Dear MarsCuriosity, What exactly is giving power to your Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator? 
Dear MarsCuriosity, How does it feel out there as you near planet Mars? Are you Cold? Hot?Or just right?

Women's BeachVolleyball on Mars: No protective ozone layer there. Solar UV would irradiate all exposed legs, buns, amp; tummies 
Rowing on Mars would log about the same race times. There's hardly any movement with or against the 62 lower gravity there.

Careful observation reveals that players amp; coaches of 3hr Baseball games spit at least 6-gal (24 liters) of saliva onto field 
Hand-stitched balls, rubbing mud, leather mitts, wooden bats, pine tar. Baseball: a game untouched by modern materials. 
FYI: Laws of physics show that it takes twice as much energy to throw a baseball 100 mph than it does to throw one at 70 mph. 
About that slow pitch: BugsBunny can throw a slower one. He's subject instead to Cartoon Laws of 
Slowest pitch in Baseball to reach catcher? 30 mph, thrown at 45-deg angle. Any slower and at any other angle hits the ground 
Does it disturb anyone else that "The Los Angeles Angels" baseball team translates directly to "The The Angels Angels"? 
Curious that intent is assigned by announcers when a batter gets a hit. Yet 70 of the time the player can't get a hit at all 
AllStarGame: Baseball is ideal for talking amp; tweeting amp; tracking stats. Only 30-min of actual playing time in a 3-hr game. 
Never figured why the Foul Pole is called the Foul Pole when it's entirely in fair territory. Should be called the Fair Pole. 
Baseball should track extraordinary plays that fielders can bank, and then credit against errors they might later commit. 
In Baseball, if a pitch hits you on ball four, you should get to advance to second base. 
You can play baseball on the airless Moon, but only if you find a way not to suffocate amp; if you don't care about curve balls. 
If baseball reported averages to 4 decimal places instead of 3, then a three-hundred hitter would be batting "three thousand" 
In the 1960s, when we still dreamed, we named a dome, a baseball team, and even the artificial turf they played on "Astro"

fractal74 Pure GPS time, from 1980 onward, adds none of the 15 LeapSeconds since then. After today they'll be 16 secs ahead 
How are Leap Seconds added? At the Prime Meridian, 12:00:00 normally follows 11:59:59pm but will instead follow 11:59:60pm 
We could, in principle, re-define the length of the second each time. Instead, we wait until one accumulates and add it whole

Wouldn't it be cool if, right about now, silhouettes of spaceships were seen escaping Venus, visible against the glowing Sun. 
Space Shuttle Endeavour, soon to rest at the Cal Sci Center, was named for Captain Cook's ship - hence the British spelling. 
Captain Cook saw the June 3, 1769 Venus Transit from South Pacific, also mapping islands there for later British colonization 
Venus Transit is historically significant because you can derive the solar system's size from precision timing of the event. 
In the era of the Telescope, there's been 258 Total Solar Eclipses but only eight Venus Transits, including today's. 
Venus transits are long amp; boring -- but rare. Every 110 years, or so, they typically come in pairs, separated by eight years. 
Kepler Telescope looks for similar brightness drops in search of exoplanets crossing our lines of sight to their host stars. 
Later today, for nearly six hours, sunlight we receive dims by 0.1 as Venus crosses Earth's line of sight to the Sun. 
Venus on my mind...

The "GREENFlash" is not a superhero but a rare spectral phenomenon of setting Sun. Best viewed at sea thru a calm atmosphere. 
The Hulk is GREEN from a potent, accidental dose of Gamma Rays. Actually, he would have died within weeks from organ failure. 
Our eyes are about 10x more sensitive to GREEN light than Red. So watt-for-watt GREEN lasers look much brighter than Red ones 
By the 1920s the GREEN-emitting element nebulium was ID'ed as oxygen, but behaving oddly in the rarefied conditions of space. 
Mid-19th century, a mysterious element was discovered in galactic nebulae. It emanated deep GREEN. Dubbed "nebulium" 
The peak sensitivity of the Human Retina is GREEN, matching the peak spectral output of the Sun. 
The Sun emits more GREEN light than any other band of light in the rainbow. 
Curiously, light-loving GREEN plants reject the Sun's GREEN light, reflecting it back at you, which is why they look GREEN. 
The laws of physics conspire to prevent GREEN stars in the universe. They basically come in three colors: Red, White, amp; Blue.

REALITY CHECK: The biological logistics of Noah's Ark: 
Area of a pizza (or any circle), is pi times radius squared. Volume of a pizza (or any cylinder) is the Area times the depth. 
Of course the volume of that pizza is: V = pi zz a Maz_Man_Utd: what about pizza volume if radius = z and thickness = a? 
A 14 inch diameter gets you 154 square inches; a 10 inch gives 78 square inches; and a 7 inch, 38 square inches - of Pizza pi 
If Pizza sizes were given in area not diameter, you'd see instantly that a 7 inch is less than half the size of a 10 inch pie

Earth's (remaining) glaciers  cloud cover greatly boost our reflectivity. The Moon is about as reflective as tire-rubber. 
In case you were curious: being larger  more reflective, full Earth on the Moon is 40x brighter than full Moon on Earth. 
Just an FYI: Crossing the sky at much higher angles, winter full Moons appear, on average, brighter than summer full Moons. 
This January eve, in a line across the sky, find Venus in twilight, moonrise in the east, and Jupiter up on high. 
The full Moon of tomorrow, and the gibbous Moon of this night, will grace our skies, dusk to dawn, in soft, majestic light.

So, contrary to popular suspicion, seasons have nothing whatsoever to do with Earth's slowly varying distance from the Sun. 
But In July, Earth's Sun-tipped axis gives N. Hemisphere's middle latitudes a factor of 5x more sunlight than in January. 
During its January close-approach to the Sun, Earth receives about 7 more sunlight than it does during July's far-approach. 
Merry Perihelion: Tonight, Earth passes closer to the Sun than any other time during its annual oval-shaped orbit.

When you can see the crescent Moon's unlit part it's called "Earthshine," but I've always preferred to call it "Moonshine"

...and why during sunset, when light passes through the most atmospheric crud, the Sun looks deep red  the sky, deep violet. 
That's also why the daytime Sun looks yellow-ish and the surrounding sky looks "sky" blue. 
And that's why a car (or truck's) fog lights are amber -- a color that penetrates the fog to illuminate the road. 
That's why a car's blueish high-beams are useless in fog - light scatters within to offer an excellent view of the fog itself 
Long wavelength red-orange part of the spectrum passes thru fog/dust/pollen while short wavelength blue-violet gets scattered 
Newton showed that white light (like sunlight) is composed of a rainbow of colors: Red-Orange-Yellow-Green-Blue-Violet.

Christians: MerryChristmas; Jews  Muslims: HappySunday; Atheists  Agnostics: HappyDay359 (Days of week are named for gods) 
Red light cuts thru fog better than white. So if Rudolph's nose did glow he'd indeed prevent Santa from flying into mountains 
Nope. I'm cool with the flying reindeer. RT sarnoski: That's what get you? Not the flying reindeer? 
According to the song, Rudolph's nose is shiny, which means it reflects rather than emits light. Useless for navigating fog. 
Seems that by now, given Santa's body weight  shape, hungry PolarBears would have mistaken him for a seal and eaten him. 
FYI: As the world warms  the Arctic melts, the PolarBear is not the only one to lose a habitat. Santa also gets cast adrift.

If baseball reported averages to four decimal places, instead of three, then a perfect hitter would be batting "ten thousand"

The "ManagerOfTheYear" award should not be a vote, but should go to who gets the most wins per dollar of player salaries paid 
On the Moon, with 1/6 of Earth's gravity, a 400 ft home run would travel nearly half a mile. Do the physics. 
If you walk on 4 pitches it should count against the pitcher. But if you walk on 8 pitches, it should count as a hit. 
RT Will_Knight3: No. If you get hit, you get to pick up the ball  throw it back at the pitcher's head. Then go to 2nd base. 
Baseball should track extraordinary plays that fielders can bank, and then credit against errors they might later commit. 
New baseball rules I'd like to see: if the pitch that hits you is ball four, you should get to advance to second base. 
You can play baseball on the airless Moon, but only if you find a way not to suffocate  if you don't care about curve balls

Congratulations to the National League. But at least a Yankee (Robinson Cano) won the Home Run derby last night. 
If baseball reported averages to four decimal places, instead of three, then a perfect hitter would be batting "ten thousand"

5th grader at son's baseball game pitched 62mph. Figured it with stop watch. Got asked "Which app?" I replied "My brain app"

Apollo in 1969. Shuttle in 1981. Nothing in 2011. Our space program would look awesome to anyone living backwards thru time. 
Not much Grump left within me. But perhaps I can eek out one more... 
The entire half-century budget of NASA equals the current two year budget of the US military. 
The US military spends as much in 23 days as NASA spends in a year - and that's when we're not fighting a war. 
The US bank bailout exceeded the half-century lifetime budget of NASA. 
NASA costs Americans half a penny on a tax dollar. That fraction of a bill is not wide enough from the edge to reach the ink. 
Just an FYI: Human access to space doesn't end with the Shuttle era, only American access. China and Russia still go there. 
When JFK committed America to land on the Moon, his projected date would have fallen under his watch as a 2-term President. 
Obama promises a future of NASA with trips to Mars on a time frame that exceeds his tenure as a 2-term President. 
If Earth were size of a school-room globe, our atmosphere wouldn't be much thicker than the coat of lacquer on its surface.

If Earth were the size of a school-room globe, the Moon would be 30-ft away. Mars, more than a mile away. 
Space Arithmetic: Mercury + Gemini + Apollo = 10 years. Shuttle = 30 years. 
Many lament the shuttle era's end. But it was boldly going where hundreds had gone before. Time to go new places. 
FYI: Commercial Space Flight will not advance the space frontier, but enable cheaper access to where we've already been. 
Other than the waging of War, the ISS (assembled by Shuttle) is the most successful collaboration of nations there ever was. 
No. I'm not in Florida for the launch today. I'm a much bigger fan of when things begin than of when they end. 
A reminder that nobody lamented the end of Gemini because Apollo was set to launch from the pad next-door. 
Many lament the shuttle era's end. But that's misplaced sentiment. Lament instead the absence of an era to replace it. 
Shuttle mission in the film "Space Cowboys" was STS-200. With the launch of Atlantis, the actual program reaches only STS-135 
The inability to predict weather across 5- days is chaos. The inability to predict weather across 5-hours is ignorance. 
AdrianNeumann Weather is chaotic over five days, not five hours. Over five hours we're just ignorant. 
Chance of storms delaying Shuttle Launch: 70. Reminder that we comprehend weather only well enough to predict statistically.

briantroberts FYI: Summer solstice is not a day but a moment during the day, separating Spring from Summer. 
Yup. One can never tire of the physics of light. 
Time delay moves hottest time of day a few hrs after "high" noon  hottest time of yr a month or two after 1st day of summer. 
So, Sun's visible light doesn't heat air, it heats ground. Ground then re-radiates IR, which heats the air - a little later. 
Air is transparent to visible light, where Sun's energy peaks. That's why we can see the Sun  each other thru atmosphere. 
Just an FYI: Counting hours of sunlight? For every day of Summer there's a matching day in Spring w/ same hours of daylight. 
Dasher3d What do I mean by "shorter days" in summer, you ask? Length of daylight, of course. The 24hr day remains intact.

Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle's landing strip is 15,000 feet long. Long enough for the brakeless Orbiter to coast to a stop. 
The SpaceShuttle alone has no engines. Fuel tanks on launch were all rented. Below Mach-1 Endeavour lands as a simple glider. 
For most of Endeavour's re-entry, it's a ballistic brick falling from the sky. Below the speed of sound, it's aerodynamic. 
When moving faster than sound, forward directed waves pile atop one another, greatly magnifying their volume: A Sonic Boom.

As Endeavour dips into Earth's atmosphere, the surrounding air heats up, whisking away the Shuttle's energy of motion. 
davidleyman Define a "scad" you ask? Officially, it's more than a bunch, but less than a boatload. 
As Endeavour's speed slows, it drops lower in Earth's atmosphere, encountering an ever-increasing density of air molecules. 
Shuttle takes 1/2 of Earth's circumference to drop 200 miles out of the sky. Slowing from 17,200mph orbit to 220mph landing 
Shuttle now executing a "de-orbit burn" dropping its path low enough to meetscads of motion-impeding air molecules. 
Just an FYI: To land, Space Shuttle Endeavour must lose all the energy of motion that it gained during launch. 
I look forward to the day when retired Space Shuttles become quaint reminders of how we used to access space.

The launch of Endeavour, for all those who slept through it. Just posted: 
Upon return  retirement, Endeavour's final resting place will be the California Science Center in Los Angeles 
In case you wondered: Space Shuttle Endeavour gets a British spelling because it's named for Captain Cook's ship. 
Columbus took three months to cross the Atlantic in 1492. The Shuttle takes 15 minutes 
Just an FYI: Within two minutes of flight, the Shuttle's air-speed exceeds that of a bullet fired from an M16 assault rifle. 
***LIFTOFF*** Eight minutes to orbit -- godspeed, Endeavour astronauts. 
Heed the check list now.... 
Shuttle's orange fuel tank has 2 internal tanks. One for Hydrogen, 2x size as one for Oxygen, giving Energy plus H2O exhaust 
Birds at the launch site are surely thinking to themselves: "These humans have come a long way with their artificial wings" 
6) "3 - 2 - 1 - Liftoff" -- SolidRocketBoosters ignite, tipping Shuttle straight upwards again. Bolts explode. Craft ascends 
5) "Main Engine Start" -- Orbiter's 3 nozzles ignite, take aim, and force shuttle to tip forward. Bolts still hold her down. 
4) Water Tower dumps a swimming-pool's worth onto the launch pad -- H2O absorbs sound vibrations, preventing damage to craft 
3) Sparks spray onto launch pad -- they burn away any potentially flammable hydrogen gathered there from the main engine. 
2) The Orbiter's 3 rocket nozzles gimbal to  fro -- a final reminder that they can aim the way they're supposed to. 
1) Orbiter's steering flaps jiggle back and forth -- a final reminder that they can angle the way they're supposed to. 
If camera-coverage enables, six cool things to look for just seconds before ignition of the SolidRocketBoosters... 
Most of Shuttle's energy accelerates it horizontally rather than vertically. Go 17,200 mph sideways  you'd reach orbit too. 
Most of the Shuttle's initial propulsion is to accelerate the mass of fuel that burns later in the launch. 
ia42 You ask for thrust units in metric tons rather than "American" tons? They're about the same. Within 10 of each other 
Endeavor gets 2.4million lbs of thrust **more** than its 4.4million lbs of weight, giving about 1/2 G acceleration on liftoff 
Endeavor weighs 4.4million lbs. If engines gave only 4.4million lbs of thrust, forces would balance, leaving it afloat on pad
