@ananavarro lol
@RonBrownstein yep
@MrSisXian Agreed. They do. But changing it after four decades and telling each candidate in 2016 it would be majority rule is an issue
"Interestingly, the Democrats used to require two-thirds support until the early 20th century."
"Every political party in the US with ballot access requires candidates obtain majority support of convention delegates, not a plurality."
"@MrSisXian I think if the party changed its rules after telling every candidate they had to go for 1237, a court probably would intervene."
@Reince Exactly. Every single political party in the United States requires it. I just got finished reading even the Green Party rules.
"8.  Trump has to adhere to the majority rule requirements of the GOP and the GOP has to as well. If he can’t get 1237, they can’t reduce it."
"7.  In other words, Trump went with a party to avoid signature requirements for an independent run.  As a result …"
6.  There is a commingling of law and rule and scrapping majority requirements would put law and rule on a collision course.
5.  The states shape ballot access under their election codes via the rules of parties with ballot access.
"4. If the party changed that rule after all the votes in the 50 states and territories had ended, there’d be legal implications because…"
3.  There are legal implications though.  The candidates ran on a rule req. of a majority of 2472 delegates.
"2. Not that the party would want to change majority rule, but the Trump supporters think a plurality should be okay."
"1. Given how intertwined party nom. processes are with ballot access laws in all 50 states, the GOP couldn’t really change the 1237 req."

Trump voters will now use the ARG poll as the reason they now ignore all polls except Drudge.
Where are the Branch Trumpidians to disrupt Cruz’s speech tonight?
“A safe and sane future.”  Cruz really rebuking Trump and the anger that has fueled him.
Thinking I’m going to need a bullet proof vest for Cleveland now.
"Email I just got:  ""Jeb Bush shot a Space Shuttle entering earth's atmosphere thereby pulling apart and killing the crew.”"

"Y’all, pray for Chris Christie.  He might not be let out of his cage tonight."
@WinterbleShow exactly.
When is Trump back on Hannity to talk about New York?
Another reminder that ARG is a garbage poll.
So it looks possible Cruz could be the nominee winning more states in his nomination process than Clinton in hers.
Cue up the “Cruz-Walker 2016” chatter.
@DavidMDrucker Yep
Significant for Cruz that his win came in prime time.  Now he needs to get out and speak in prime time too — a rarity for his campaign.
There we have it.  Cruz is called the winner of Wisconsin by the press.

@ScooterSchaefer But the poll sample was 72 people.

The coming plugola/payola investigations over Trump support are going to be revealing.

We’re on the verge of really finding out if the talking heads who call themselves “conservative” really are conservative or Trumpeteers.
"“I can’t trust Cruz because he didn’t hit Trump when I wanted him to,” is silly when Cruz is the only one repeatedly beating Trump now."
@eyeformation @conradclose https://t.co/ixKpxQey0J  Cruz struck at the right time.
@conradclose That people are still stuck on this says more about the people stuck on it than on Cruz.
"@conradclose His objective was to win, not to humor anti-Trump voters who wanted him to stand up to Trump."
"@conradclose I’m sorry, but I think that’s actually b.s.  Cruz waited until he was within striking distance in the polls then did it."
Hail Victory! https://t.co/CbZTw98uHv
Lotta good Trump did by bailing on CPAC for Kansas.
Tonight we’ll see if Rubio supporters really want to beat Trump or are as much a cult of personality as Trump’s supporters.
"“Cruz’s best states are behind him,” said Rubio supporters on Wednesday.  “Cruz’s best states are behind him,” they’ll say tomorrow too."
The Rubio campaign hurt itself by repeatedly talking about a brokered convention strategy instead of a win races strategy.

"Given his sensitivity to the issue, maybe we should call him Donald Stump."
@Oxco Rubio is there.
I wish I had not seen the Ghostbusters trailer.  Yuck.
Trump is a chicken. Bailed on CPAC. Won't stand up to Putin. Can't take on Megyn Kelly either.
Ugh. Apparently Rubio has the flu. Poor guy. Prayers for him.
@McCormackJohn LOL
America needs more leaders like @BenSasse
Seriously people — Marco has a cold.  Good for him not shaking hands.
I hate it for Marco that he has a cold.  Miserable to be on the campaign trail like that.  But he still did well.
Cruz won this debate. https://t.co/DVqOj8xYFP
@ellencarmichael Where’s Ted’s series of tweets using  #NeverTrump
