emilycrockett nope but whatevs 
emilycrockett I think you're taking our piece and trying to get it to fit a meme we studiously avoided 
DougMoore2 he said something rather controversial and I thought it was worth asking the Trump campaign about it 
emilycrockett no -- more that it didn't bring people in to join a common mission 
RIP via youtube 
BilDowns the confidence of knowing one is right includes letting the other side speak 
emilycrockett we didn't make it about being self centered AT ALL. It was about the drawback of one's experience as a campaign pitch. 
Racheldoesstuff do you remember Ariel Bashi, a friend of Dan's? he works for me and says hi 
BilDowns the best. (ERM not JM) 
emilycrockett and the numbers really only worked in contrast with Sanders who had the exact opposite 2:1 ratio 
emilycrockett our point wasnt about it making her seem self-centered. it was about "we" being more of a calling to supporters. 
Racheldoesstuff so much buzz even a boring old soon-to-be-out-of-the-demo newsman had to see what the fuss was about and it was great!
