"Haha RT@daveweigel: Weird. Santorum doesn't like the idea of ""anything goes"" on the Internet. I'll google his name and figure out why"
Boos for CNN's SOPA advocacy.
Romney is not nearly as comfortable talking about his wealth as he wants us to think he is.
"Political fact: the more candidates talk about the past, the smaller the circle of people who care."
Santorum has Newts number.
"By ""Newt's a friend - I love him,"" Santorum means I hate his face."
@isaacsarver yes all too well
There is a real earnestness to how Ron Paul just warns us of what's coming as opposed to hypothesizing about a Paul presidency.
How ironic that candidate Obama opposed the mandate?
