Welcome to the next six months of campaigning  https://t.co/AHUWqCcQBU
"I just caught myself humming ""homeward bound"" from Simon and Garfunkel as I just read another tweet about ""unbound"" delegates."
@JoeTrippi @stephenfhayes @KarlRove everyone is right. Trump a tougher foe for Clinton but Cruz prob better nominee for downballot GOPers
"There was a time the Obama WH wasn't the most nimble political shop re: down ballot. Tonight, they had hand in both MDSEN and PASEN victors"
I believe tonight is the first time a presidential candidate named Clinton won a CT Prez primary. Bill lost in 92 and Hillary in 08
Corrected grammar: anyone else get the feeling Trump is holding this long presser as a way to taunt Manafort?
Anyone else get the feeling that Trump his holding his long presser tonight almost as a to taunt Manafort?
"You know where you learn the best words, from like the best schools.   https://t.co/JmOyC6xL5k"

"MLB blackout rules R absurd! Even if u have ""At Bat"" ""Extra Innings"" &amp; season tickets, still can't watch Nats 2night on iPad from philly"
@joe_kehoskie a delegate in DE is worth just as much as a delegate in MT.  Stop Trump didn't even build a speed bump in these 5 states
"Once in Cleveland in July, we could end up looking back at tonight as the Most consequential Tuesday of the primary year for Trump."
Tonight is turning into a clarifying night for the two frontrunners.  Both Clinton and Trump have only gotten stronger in their primaries.
I see what you did there https://t.co/dsAiSrW5gt
Earlier a candidate speaks usually is an indication they know they will have a bad night  https://t.co/RDTz0Nqnkp
Reminder: Dem &amp; GOP parties are private orgs; can set own rules for how to choose nominees. Doesn't legally have to be (small d) democratic
Sanders indicting the state parties in places like NY and PA and elsewhere that do NOT allow indies to vote in Dem primaries.
Agree.  It is he ONLY positive development for the stop Trump movement since Wis https://t.co/bzyTMpKtIN
@mab8663Panto you owed me a warning
Important clarification.  It's also the word I toss back at folks when they complain about our voting systems.   https://t.co/FobsBP1yKd
One of Bill Clinton's late primary losses in '92 was to Jerry Brown in Connecticut.  Don't be surprised if CT is one of the closer Dem races

Trump may be having a stronger night than anti Trump folks thought an hour ago.  Could he go 4-1 and have a delegate lead over 250 or more?
"Looks like the Chicago incident really hurt Trump in Illinois.  Once again, what GOPers thought would hurt him only makes him stronger?"
Classic Kasich.  He is always off the cuff.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  https://t.co/qdXXVaFBYl
Trump will not surpass 50% tonight in any state.  He has only surpassed 45% in four states.  He needs 50%+ consistently to avoid convo fight

She said what? https://t.co/vtKzRNs8Q8
"Among GOPers in NC OH and MO, via combined exit data, Rubio voters would break 4-1 in favor of Cruz if the choice was just Trump v Cruz."
"Kasich would need 110% of remaining delegates to win nomination before convention.  #mathproblem. But if ""deny Trump"" is goal then he stays"
A contested convention is more possible now: NBC calls OH for Kasich. Is this Trump's only loss tonight or does Cruz nab one or more?
As @mmurraypolitics points out: Clinton dominated the early vote in FL OH and NC.  Proves campaign mechanics do matter.
"While the GOP doesn't have ""SuperDelegates,"" the 200-300 ""unbound delegates"" on their side will have similar power to vote who they want"
"Many of Rubio's delegates will be unbound, rules vary by state though.   https://t.co/c4NpgT2FBf"
"NBC officially calls OH for Clinton.  She has her ""victory"" for the night now.  She won the three swing states. FL, OH and NC."
Concession speeches always reveal honest assessments of the electorate that make you wonder why the candidate didn't acknowledge it sooner

"Check out the ""winning states"" maps for both Trump and Clinton.  Where would each be without the South. Near clean sweeps for both."

"Asked Dems in exits who would have best chance against Trump: Clinton topped Sanders in every state: 63% OH, 74% FL, 68% NC, 65% IL &amp; 58% MO"
"Among GOPers in 3 Nov swing states voting today, 41% in OH wd seriously consider 3rd party Cand in Trump v Clinton, 39% in NC and 30% in FL"

@Icechoclate @jeffjarvis @realDonaldTrump it's not about me
Just 2 days until winner-take-all primaries in Ohio and Florida. We have complete analysis on these decisive contests this morning on #MTP.
We’ll discuss the Democratic side ahead of Tuesday's contests. Can Clinton maintain her delegate lead or will Sanders continue his momentum?
Can Rubio defeat Trump in his home state of FL? Is the GOP headed for a contested convention? We’ll answer these Qs &amp; more. #MTP
Joining me this morning for analysis ahead of Ohio and Florida contests are: @DorisKGoodwin @hughhewitt @alexcast @agearan #MTP
"This morning on #MTP, I’ll sit down with @tedcruz to discuss the tightening race between him and Trump and his strategy going forward."
@joel_fields looking forward to the start of the new season.

Hundreds pay tribute to #NancyReagan in a touching farewell. A symbolic end to the Reagan era? That's next on @MSNBC. #MTPDaily
"Just 15 mins until #MTPDaily and our lead is the latest Trump rally which no one saw outside St Louis.  Needless to say, A LOT of protesters"
The year started off so promising for GW hoops and then they hit a wall sometime in mid Jan and never recovered.  Bummer #hailtothebuff

"Debates hurt Jeb.  They've hurt Rubio. They helped Fiorina.  One thing they've never done, is impact Trump good or bad.  Expect same tonight"
Seems like all the candidates not named Kasich tonight noticed their personal ratings all took a hit due to previous debate scuffles
And @ericwinston you get to hang in a swing state during a Prez race.  If you think politics is fascinating now... https://t.co/RnQvI9VNpH

"@JohnTheAlrighty correct.  Trump is not winning black voters, he wins in states (and counties) with higher proportions of an AfAm pop."

"We believe there is anywhere from 150-180k votes out just in 3 counties. Wayne, Macomb and Genesee.  On paper, should be good for Clinton"
Everything breaking Trump's way tonight because none of his 4 foes can claim any momentum tonight.  Sets him up well in 7 days.
"Michigan is going to be a nail biter.  Outstanding vote favors Clinton, but will it be enough?  May take until 90 percent counted to call it"
@ManahawkinMikey @dukemeiser not quite all.   But a bigger chunk
Tonight playing out about as well as Trump could ask.  Flirting with 50 in MS. Neither Cruz nor Kasich w/ signif momentum and Rubio craters
"For anti-Trump GOPers, they must feel like Charlie Brown &amp; the football.  Every time they think they have momentum to stop him, voters vote"
Twitter is broken enough.  https://t.co/zvDmxI0wxl
Rubio may be fourth in both MI and MS.  Delegate shutout. HI and ID better come through for him if he wants any mo in next 6 days
NBC projecting Trump in MS now. Cruz second.  Key is whether Trump can get to 50 percent.  He has a shot.  Helps his delegate math BIG time

Dad humor https://t.co/1ct6p5h3yZ
Cruz is winning late deciders in MS but not by a huge margin. Trump was competitive with late deciders
"While nearly 60% of MS GOPers would be ""satisfied"" if either Trump or Cruz is nominee.  57% of MS GOPers would be ""dissatisfied"" w/Rubio"
"By a 60-34 margin, MS GOPers want next POTUS to be outside estab. Cruz wins voters who want experience in next POTUS.  Trump wins outsider"
"Majority of MS GOP voters echo MI GOP voters on trade, 53% say trade ""takes away US jobs"""
"""Change"" voters favor Trump in MS by 2-1 margin.  ""Values"" voters favor Cruz in MS by an even bigger margin."
Canary in the general election coal mine? Massive gender gap between Trump and Cruz in MS.  Will compare to see if it is among largest

"Trump is testing the limits of the durability of his coalition, because this is not a steady performance tonight"
"Kasich with the best defense of insider experience that I've heard at a debate. Don't know if it works, but it was sharp"
Let's move to the economy and then ask a question about an insult.  That's how NOT to create a debate on the economy.

Four hours and 51 mins now  https://t.co/SLAV72jf6E
Cruz and Rubio camps are no longer pretending they can win this nomination before Cleveland. Both camps pushing convention scenarios.
According to number crunching by @LACaldwellDC there has been record GOP turnout in every state so far except VT.
"So far, Rubio hasn't made threshold anywhere in TX.  Chance he could get skunked in TX.  But not done calculating by CD just yet"
"If Kasich comes up short in VT, he's now in unenviable position of being winless.  Estab pressure will increase on Kasich. He cost Rubio VA"
"Rubio got a desperately needed win in MN, being winless was an ugly talking point, that's now gone."
"In the 9 primary states, Trump has 7 wins or leads, Cruz has 2 wins and Rubio shut out.   Cruz and Rubio each have 3 2nd place finishes"
"The OK GOP primary was closed.  No indies or Dems could vote, tailored made for Cruz."
Hard to see how Cruz doesn't nab the second place delegate slot after tonight is all said and done.  Tough night for Rubio.  Needs MN badly
Trump's margin over Rubio in VA is about 30k.  Kasich has just under 70k votes.
"Final waves have more working class voters and like Santorum in 2012, Trump voters vote late https://t.co/KtuIAGVpNu"
Less than 90 mins to the start of NBC News' Super Tuesday special. Already a fascinating night.  See u then https://t.co/kaJ3OZceVl
"Top two GOP wants for next Prez have been ""bring needed change"" &amp; ""shares my values"".  Trump dominates change, Cruz narrowly leads values"
"And remember, in VA, the last precincts to report are always in NoVA, which tonight means a late Rubio surge as the count gets closer to end"
VA GOP electorate looks a lot different than just about every other southern state tonight.  Explains why Rubio is close
NBC calls GA for Trump and Clinton.  VT for Sanders and VA for Clinton.  VA GOP is too close to call. VT GOP side is too early to call

@Haunsie not a dig. Just a fact
"If Clinton replicates SC numbers on Super Tuesday, it's close to game/set/match for Dem nod. Only hurdle left is out of her control: the FBI"
Updated SC exits w/final interviews give Clinton even BIGGER lead among AfAm vote (87-13) and she now LEADS among white Dems (53-47). Wow
"And now Clinton starts the pivot toward Trump with what makes America great riff... A week ago, Clinton camp was rife w/staff shakeup rumors"
"""Especially for young people!"" There's the beginning of Clinton trying to woo Sanders supporters w/o attacking Bernie (anymore?)"
"The white Dem vote strength for Sanders should help him in MN, OK, CO and MA.  Campaign may regret not targeting TN and VA more"
Sanders did better among SC white Dems than I thought. Basically he did just about as well with SC white Dems as he did w/NH white Dems
Clinton now has new challenge if Super Tuesday looks like tonight: beating Sanders without alienating his supporters.
Not a surprise that Clinton would win SC but her overwhelming lead among African Americans is just astonishing.  84-16.  That's Obama-esque

This is a gutsy position for Trump. Re: Israeli-Palestinian issue
"Trump just keeps digging on this audit business.  Feels like a massive unforced error.  Then again, this is Teflon Don"
Trump's audit defense on the tax returns is not good at all.   And Cruz and Rubio have both pounced
"Cruz did a pretty good job of making an electability case against Trump, but Trump's rebuttal was strong"
Trump got exposed for not having a detailed health care replacement plan.  But does that matter to his voters?
Rubio is actively trying to get under Trump's skin and it appears to be working.

We’ve got a packed show today after last night’s SC/NV contests! Tune in for interviews with 4 candidates on #MTP. https://t.co/itLq7XAxZ6
"Trump said in his victory speech that he wants to wrap this up soon. Has two early chances: beat Cruz in Tx on 3/1, beat Rubio in FL on 3/15"
"Have the voters in 2016 have overturned Citizens United on their own? SuperPacs are overrated.  Still can be helpful, but not a replacement"
"Just like Trump followed Jeb in announcing, Trump now follows Jeb dropout speech with his own victory speech."
Rubio got his golden ticket tonight: a slew of Jeb donors who now are free to join.  But is it in time?
The underwritten story of the night: the end of the Bush dynasty.
@AnnCoulter see the next tweet I sent.  Pope got him back on message
Carson is a Cruz spoiler and Jeb/Kasich are Rubio spoilers (Kasich folks would say Rubio is their spoiler)
"@JonahNRO @meetthepress perhaps a new litmus.  Voters should know, highest scorer should be kicked off the stage."
"@JonahNRO @meetthepress which candidate would score the highest on that weird ""test""?"
"Shakeup Saturday makes way for ""Clarity Sunday"".  Lead guests so far for @meetthepress Trump and Sanders.  More to come"
"Character traits tell the story for the next month: Trump won change voters, Cruz won values voters and Rubio won electability voters"
Trump's win is consistent enough across the state that he could even more delegates than folks projected
History may show that Trump spat with Pope on immigration may have helped get the frontrunner back on his most powerful message.
"Trump won this week despite coming out for health care mandate, defending planned parenthood, blaming Bush for 9/11, standing by impeachment"
"Trump is putting together the same ideological coalition that Romney and McCain did in 08 and 12, winning ""somewhat conservs"" and mods"
SC has gotten the nominee right every year since 1980 sans one: 2012.  Gingrich won SC but lost to Romney
NBC News call: Trump in SC.
"And ""somewhat conservs"" outnumber everyone.  Somewhats and moderates account for 60 percent of SC electorate"
"Cruz winning among ""very conservative"" voters by double digits.  But Trump winning ""somewhat conserve"" and moderates by high single digits"
@SassyGabe it may have been unintentional but it could have been Freudian
"Sanders: his last line is about being ""on to Super Tuesday"" Translation: SC doesn't matter"
"@samhwils ""exit"" not ""entrance"".  The caucus polls are ""entrance"" and less accurate"
@GregMitch they are a rare chance to speak to millions of folks at one time thanks to saturation coverage
@DuBoisTom multi candidate field
First time in three contests where Clinton genuinely seems like she won something.  Iowa was a win but she didn't speak like one then
Team Sanders may be feeling burned by Harry Reid helping Clinton at end. When you run against estab eventually estab works against you.
"Today could be known as ""sigh of relief Saturday"" for Clinton."
It's official: Clinton wins Nevada.  Bigger deal in the long run for her.  Pressure turns to Sanders. Where can he start winning
"Those casino caucus sites are approx 1% of the entire electorate, just FYI"
"Clinton is up 9 in Clark and there's still a decent chunk of Clark County out, the single most important county in NV"
"Everything still close but based on what's in and what's not in, you'd rather be Clinton than Sanders right now based solely on Clark county"
@cherry_bethea not until later
@BeverleeHughes3 I hope you are asking out of the goodness of your heart and not as a twitter troll!
@gordonmiami that was HIGHLY disappointing...I expected a better effort...
"Entrance polls are NOT as accurate as exit polls due to how things change in the caucus itself, so extra grain of salt"

@AlanIAbramowitz @politicalwire careful. You appear to be rooting for us to be an outlier.  Try waiting before judging.
@AlanIAbramowitz can't call us an outlier yet since no other poll is out totally post GOP debate.
@Johnnyyumaaz averages are less reliable today because there is a lot of bad polls included now.
@brettjtalley of course we could be an outlier.  We also are only poll conducted completely post GOP debate.

"That was a tough first hour for Rubio. Christie was brutal against him. So far, that's the story."
That was Christie's best anti-Rubio hit of the night. Tad more nuanced and yet just as tough. Re: immigration
This debate is a bit herky jerky.  Starts in on some interesting topics but then abruptly changes course.
"Don't know if Christie was helped with Rubio take down, but clearly Rubio was hurt during that exchange."
Every candidate on that stage loving what Christie is doing to Rubio but there's a line between attacking and bullying.
"Christie is doing exactly what Bush, Trump, Cruz, and Kasich all want him to do to Rubio."
The Biden quip was a tad odd.
When your explaining....  Cruz is spending way too much time trying to rationalize what happened in Iowa.

@sissenberg @hunterw @StefanRingel you don't count john Kerry?
@edatpost he will get one delegate.
The three campaigns whose results lived up to their spin even in the face of media skepticism: Cruz Rubio and Sanders.
"Top Sanders grps: 17-29yo (84%) ""Honest&amp;trustworthy"" (83%) ""more liberal policies (76%)
income inequality (61%) 1st time attendee (59%)"
"Key Clinton grps: ""Can win in Nov"" (77%) 65+ (69%) ""Cont Obama policies"" (68%)
Terrorism top issue (65%)
Previous attendee (59%)
Mod (58%)"
@JoeLenski @ElectProject an error in Sanders favor?
"Sanders may have made the mistake Santorum made in 2012, not seizing the mic sooner to declare ""success"".  Getting very late in the east"
"A ""big sigh of relief"" style of thank you to Iowa still means she stopped short of fully declaring victory"
Clinton has been careful not to actually declare victory
"Key groups won by Trump: 1st time caucus (31%)
Immigration #1 issue (45%)
""Tells it like it is"" (67%)
Decided before the last month (40%)"
"Key groups won by Rubio: college grads (27%) most worried about jobs (30%) can win in November (43%)
Decided in the last few days  (29%)"
"Key groups won by Cruz: Previous attendees (31%) Very conserv (43%) Evangelical (33%) Terrorism top worry (33%) ""Shares my values"" (37%)"
Wonder why Cruz is waiting so long to declare victory? Missed the east coast local news window (see NH and SC)
Wouldn't be surprised if there was a flood of endorsements for Rubio in the next week.
"This may be the closest IA Dem caucus result since 1988 when to this day, Simon campaign vets believe they were robbed by Gephardt."
There is nothing in our models that backs up the Clinton campaign confidence that they won. They still might.  But it is thiCsLose
Trump didn't say a negative thing about a single GOPer tonight.  Notable
Iowa was must win for Cruz. NH is now must win for Trump.
Trump plans to take the stage after Rubio finishes.  Big test for him.  How does he handle losing.
"Still, that's a lot of money Team Bush spent for what could be just one delegate in Iowa."
Our initial delegate allocation estimates for GOP indicate that even Bush might get one delegate based on IA allocation system.
"Rubio campaign very savvy to claim the first ""victory"" speech slot of the night"
How a candidate handles a concession speech on a night like this will tell us about their staying power.
Clinton source gloating: Sanders got turnout he needed and yet they believe she won.  Too close for us to call just yet.
Official. NBC has called it for Cruz.
We have 97% of GOP vote in. Cruz up 28-24 over Trump. But Rubio is just 2200 votes behind Trump and is at 23%
Only drama left on GOP side is whether Rubio catches Trump for second.  Now that's a surprise.
@StuPolitics hopefully folks will realize. That they need 40 pound bags of salt with their results
"On the Dem side, best news Clinton got was that Q poll showing Sanders ahead because if she wins then she survived. Win is a win"
"If this holds on GOP side, then Cruz shows he could take a punch. Rubio has the spark he needed and Trump now faces a must win in NH"
"My pollster pals will love this nugget: Cruz winning ""very conservatives"" Rubio winning ""somewhat conservatives"" Trump winning ""moderates"""
Rubio and Sanders won the late deciders according to entrance polls
Updated entrance poll indicates GOP electorate has gotten slightly more conservative.  Good news for Cruz
"@Jamesthesnake the ""very conservative"" number is down 10 points from 2012"
Sanders wants a more liberal electorate and Trump needs a less conservative electorate. Both getting what they need. So far
"Dem electorate is more than 10 points more liberal than 2008. The GOP electorate is nearly 10 points less on the ""very conservative"" front"
"Word of warning on entrance polls, they are useful for finding out who is showing up, first timers etc.  But the horse race is not bankable"

Interesting that no other candidate on stage wanted to butt in and tangle with Cruz on ethanol issue. Cruz caught a break
Cruz trying to blur the lines on ethanol issue; will be interesting to see who on stage decides to hug Branstad and push back
"But the more muddled this debate is, it ends up only helping one candidate... ""the elephant not in the room."""
"Christie handled bridge Q very well, but the moderators haven't helped him engage with Rubio and Cruz as much as he needs to be right now"
"About 6 weeks ago, Rand Paul seemed to decide, time to go back to his Libertarian comfort zone. Found his voice again, but is there time?"
Cruz took some incoming (less than I expected). Rubio had a strong start but immigration ties him in knots
"This is a tough debate to declare a clear winner. Some candidates had great moments that won't play well w/GOP base, for instance, Jeb"
"Immigration may be THE decisive issue for many primary voters and yet tonight's debate muddled it for everyone, esp Cruz &amp; Rubio"
There's a Google color coded state by state search map here in debate spin room.  And Trump is most searched in every state for this debate
Wow.  That was quite a montage Fox put together to ask Cruz that immigration question.   Will be curious if other candidates get montages
Disappointing that the Ferguson question was only directed to Paul. Too bad they didn't get a few others to weigh in
"Meanwhile, Santorum is addressing Trump's crowd right now. What a surreal scene. What has this campaign come to?"
Rubio continues to show the most comfort on stage when topic is national security.  He's been very strong for those looking for a hawk
"""Hate action"" -- For GOP primary voters, many will believe Rubio owned that domestic terrorism vs protected speech question."
Much tougher for Cruz to score points on media bashing when it is a Fox event.
"With that last Christie hit, I believe there have now been more Hillary mentions than Trump mentions, just 26 mins into debate"
Imagine if this Ben Carson had been this comfortable on stage when he was a frontrunner. He's truly improved at this format
"Rubio's ""i do respect Rand"" comment seemed like a not so subtle shot at Cruz. Surprised he kept that so subtle"
"Well, who had Rand Paul in the ""who will attack Ted Cruz first"" pool?"
It is two VERY different scenes at the Trump rally and the GOP debate.  There is a rock concert feel to the Trump event. Lower key at debate
"Cruz gets the chance to be the ""leader"" of the anti-Trump brigade on stage; good moment for him, which was handed to him"

"This line is rebuttal like for POTUS: ""will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation?"""

"Overall, there were too many candidates pressing tonight which at times detailed the debate esp in hour 2."
Jeb finally found his voice against Trump but was it too little too late?
"Of non top tier, both Christie and Bush had good nights with Christie probably helping himself the most.  But he was a tad too hot at times"
This was Rubio's toughest debate mostly because he didn't get glide by without taking incoming. Will his immigration stance stop his rise?
"Trump and Cruz came into the night as the co-leaders and they leave in same place.  Both held up, prob cause they didn't hit each other"
"@brianjameswalsh he has until March. We went through this research and to get on 50 state ballots, March is when he needs to begin"

"Well, after keeping his cool a bit, looks like Trump couldn't keep his kid on for more than a hour.  When did Trump hate attention?"
There's a point where tough talk comes across as trying too hard.  There are a lot of candidates pressing tonight.
This has been one of Trump's better debate performances overall. He seems more comfortable and in control of his emotions
"""I served on the Armed Services Committee for 18 years..."" Is probably a line that never should be uttered in an anti-Washington year"

Rubio's position on national security is more in line with GOP primary voters but Cruz defended himself quite effectively just now
Rubio v Cruz in a smaller debate setting would be quite the event.

@JohannaHouman assessing how candidates did and how it may impact campaign is neutrality
"As for Jeb, he seemed more comfortable than he has in the other three debates but was he impactful with voters?"
Paul easily had his best debate night of campaign.  Cruz and Carly had good moments too. Rubio did no harm.  Kasich was (too?) aggressive.
Hard debate to say who was a clear winner.  The two frontrunners struggled more than rest of field but prob not enough to see poll fall
Climate change and min wage were topics at this debate.
Cruz is showing why so many insiders think he'll eventually be in the final two or three when the field winnows
This is the Paul on foreign policy that many thought would be a bigger player in primary. He hasn't been helped by Trump sharing his views
Both Jeb and Carly challenged Trump on Russia but Carly is owning her moment in a big way.
Folks are finding out Trump has similar isolationist tendencies as Paul.
"Trump's bragging about being on ""60"" w/Putin &amp;seeming like they cd be pals would be problematic for any other GOPer. Why isn't for him?"
"Jeb has done fine with the time he's had but again, there are large gaps between times he feels involved"
Would love to hear one of the candidates take time to explain currency manipulation.  Wonder how many would feel comfortable if asked
This last 15 minutes has been Rand Paul's best so far of all four debates.  He was being who he is without coming across angry or annoyed
Trump trying to play the party uniter!?!?  And flex his frontrunner muscles
"Hmmm, why did Cruz pick sugar subsidies, of all things he could think of.  Has nothing to do with a certain FL senator on stage does it?"
Paul tosses a defense budget grenade on to the debate stage.
"Been very few debate moments.  Ah, and as I write, here we go.  Rubio v Paul."
I get there is an extra effort to not force candidate engagement tonight but I get sense candidates would like to debate more than they are
Did Cruz say Commerce twice? Better than being a Texan who forgets which agency they are killing.  #NBC2016
Eliminating the IRS may sound good but do folks who cheer really believe the agency will get abolished?
@JohnJHarwood true.  Though his name is on a bill that agrees with them.
Haven't looked at @DomenicoNPR's time chart but guessing Kasich and Fiorina are on top.  Kasich a tad too hot tonight?
@NolteNC some in the newspaper industry would say new media drove down wages
"There's Cruz, taking the Trump side of the immigration argument over the Bush-Kasich-Rubio side."
Kasich and Bush trying to make a pragmatic argument on immigration to a primary electorate that may have lost faith in GOP pragmatism
...That's the sound of a bunch of reporters scrambling for Eisenhower biographies.
"Interesting Trump aside on his deporting plan ""hopefully they'll come back"""
"Wish some of these questions were asked of every candidate, including min wage q."
Good early questions being wasted because every candidate has tried too hard to get some stump lines in. Folo to Kasich got some specifics
Questions are solid.  Most candidates avoiding specifics though.
The two Republicans running who have publicly come out in favor of some raising of the min wage: Huckabee and Santorum.  Neither on stage
I think we know the answer for better debates. Four person debates are great.  Imagine three of them.  Rather than one 8 person.
Both Huckabee and Santorum bring a little economic issue diversity when it comes to the debate about wages and trade. Won't be on main stage
Not a single candidate on stage tonight has worn the uniform.  Only veteran running now is Graham. #NBC2016
Big charge by Christie to claim Fed isn't raising rates to protect POTUS.  Tough to prove. Perhaps good politics but produces cynicism.
"#CarlyFiorina defends her lack of a detailed tax plan. I'll ask @MikeNeedham how that's playing with conservatives, next on #MTPDaily."

Was there a single public KY GOV poll that wasn't done via IVR or some non-traditional methodology?
Getting an array of responses to these Dem Party apparatus tweets: from too many Dems running away from him to rural-urban cultural splits
Possible it's about Dems failing to motivate their voters outside a prez year. But the off-years are where a party build its infrastructure
What's the answer/reason? Some will argue Team Obama never translated their expertise to the rest of party. But clearly something's wrong
"Name Dem org &amp; it seems their GOP counterpart has either out messaged, out spent or out-maneuvered. Dem bench down ballot getting wiped out"
"Meanwhile, outside of Obama's campaigns in 2008 and 2012, the Dem track record everywhere else is, well, abysmal since his election."
States are laboratories of democracy; nat'l GOP leaders will be watching closely to see how or if Bevin can repeal/replace health care in KY
The anti-Obama playbook worked in #kygov.  Now the RGA heads to #LAGOV to see if same message can rescue Vitter in another red state
Happiest KY officeholder in DC tonight is Rand Paul. Bevin win relieves pressure some KY GOPers might have exerted on him re: WH v SEN
@politicalwire most of the KY polling I've seen recently hasn't been from pollsters with long track records
"If this holds in KY, it will mean Conway would have lost winnable races as a Dem nominee for House (KY 03) in 02, senate in 10 and Gov."

Dems claiming a DOUBLE-DIGIT lead in the #LAGOV runoff. It's anti-Vitter vs anti-Obama on the LA airwaves. https://t.co/J3oHhR98UE
@proteinwisdom @jpodhoretz a shred of humor not allowed?
"Test for Jeb going forward is how he handles this tough moment.  As Steve Schmidt notes, the candidate who shows most resiliency wins"
"If Rubio ends up the nominee, this debate performance will be considered one of, if not, THE moment. #nbc2016"
"Kasich left out one more profit center at Ohio State, their football program #NBC2016"
"So far, I think every candidate has had a moment worth touting or YouTubing... except Bush. #NBC2016"
"Huckabee is right about the ""only guy"" deal. Would make a good meme... #NBC2016"
@jpodhoretz Menshevik was new to me. Are they socialists who speak Yiddish?
"Rubio has a similar gift that both Dubya and B. Clinton had, he personalizes policy proposals. #drycleaner #scorp #NBC2016"
Huckabee's call on curing those four diseases that drive health care costs was a taste of the Huckabee that broke through in 2008 #NBC2016
Here is where Trump hit Rubio on Zuckerberg and H1B1 visas... on his own web site. https://t.co/kTwaKWklNv
Is Donald Trump still on stage? #NBC2016
Carson showed some political nimbleness with that initial response on CostCo. He's not been that quick before. #NBC2016
Important enough breaking news to interrupt my debate tweets. Solid hire (I hope) https://t.co/LmjTTJEVr7
Rubio is easily the best deflector on this debate stage; weaves personal narrative exceedingly well #NBC2016
Rubio campaign clearly believes this exchange helped them https://t.co/UZFzhmS9Z2
@NolteNC He only has one gear. I've talked fantasy football with him and he is as passionate
Carson has definitely improved his energy and style compared to the first two debates. #NBC2016
Check out blind quote 4 in @mikeallen Playbook this ayem. Cruz almost uttered line word for word. Pre-planned hit https://t.co/KUPxVysnlo
"Remember, when a pol doesn't like a question or doesn't want to answer a question, default is to attack the media. Centuries old tradition"
"Christie has already talked about running against Hillary Clinton twice... Rubio once, everyone else more focused on each other or media"
Cruz was probably just done a favor with potential supporters just now by being cut off. #NBC2016
"Thought the candidates were going to go rogue tonight and sure enough, they have. #NBC2016"
Bush doesn't do planned attacks well at these debates; he's better when PURELY off the cuff. #NBC2016
"No one can say Rubio wasn't ready for this attack from Bush tonight... And thanks to the rules of the debate, Rubio got the last word"
Rubio's pushback on Sun-Sentinel was an attempt to make it harder for other GOPers to take the side of the media. #NBC2016
"Rubio with a strong response about ""waiting in line"" --""waiting for what"" -- meanwhile, ""turn the page"" is a phrase from Obama 2008 #NBC2016"
"Of the plans we've studied at #MTP, Kasich's looks more like a plan that could survive in some form in a divided Congress. #NBC2016"
"Fiorina with a reality check; She's right, lots of talk on the GOP side about major tax reform pledges for years, no follow thru #NBC2016"
"Carson started steady in defending his tax plan at first and then... a reminder, the economic policy is not his comfort zone"
Carson does seem like he has more energy tonight than the previous two debates
Trump playing defender of Carson... And one thing Trump does prep for re: debates; oppo research
Kasich is trying to pick a fight with BOTH Trump and Carson... the Medicaid/Medicare attack is on Carson
"""All the deductions and all the loopholes"" -- how Carson says his 15% flat tax will work. ""all the deductions"" means mortgage dedux too?"
@MarcACaputo except when they write editorials on a debate day that directly channel a talking point of one candidate vs another

First home state blowback for Rubio on his rant against the Senate. Sun-sentinel calls for resignation https://t.co/ZqM2p4evtE
"Hey @finebaum, I know you are being provocative, but the SEC didn't know what real college football was until Miami reinvented it."
I just love the way the Royals play baseball.  Mets are tough too. Have no dog in this Series but am enjoying Game 1 in general.
Kasich joins Bush and Rubio in being extremely open about their own frustrations with campaign and/or day job.  No happy warriors right now
How's Trump handling his first real poll/driven adversity? That and the latest on the Dem side in IA on @NBCNightlyNews in 5 mins
"#DonaldTrump highlights #BenCarson's faith, saying he doesn't know about Seventh-day Adventists. I'm going to talk to one next on #MTPDaily."
#BenCarson surges ahead of #DonaldTrump in a national poll. I'll talk to two moderators of tomorrow's #CNBCGOPDebate next on #MTPDaily.
"It seems both Jeb and Rubio have ""when the going gets tough"" questions to answer. Fine line between expressing frustration and hopelessness"

@GoldenCanesClub just hope the school realizes they need to offer the boosters some reason for hope NOW.  We've waited long enough
So two tough polls in one state and Trump goes into full attack mode on Bloomberg and Carson's religion? Over reaction is understatement
@davehydesports I assume he means no changes today.  What about Sunday or Monday
@GregKell agreed.  Can't linger for rest of season. Players won't play
@JWGOP yeah. They have to act now
"Other reason Miami may have to act now, too many openings at programs who will pay more: both USCs and the Univ of Under Armor (aka MD)"
Remember the days when Miami's third teamers played he way Clemson's third teamers are?
@ChuckRabin let Kehoe finish the season.
"If the answer from Miami tomorrow on Golden is ""assess at the end of the season"" it will demoralize all involved.  This team has quit"
Worst thing to do to Golden is to let the cloud hover for rest of the season.  Either keep him definitively or fire him now.
"Well, I think Al Golden has his signature game."
@shuffman08 I've hesitated tweeting that but I don't know if I can hold back anymore
@KennethDeweese that excuse is a joke. USC had it worse.
"@MomMilkshake @MarcACaputo if he school cares about the fans, they will act this week.  Letting this continue isn't fair to anyone involved"
Clemson O is just toying with Miami's defense. It's comical how lost the team D looks so now they are just playing prevent. #makethisstop
Clemson is no doubt a great team but talent difference isn't that great. It is the game preparation that is the difference maker #GoCanes
Does Miami EVER have a smart play out of a timeout? A wildcat for no gain at start of 2ndQ?  Ridiculous play call
"The sad thing about watching Miami at this point is that while I have high expectations, this oddly isn't surprising."
This is absolutely embarrassing to be losing like this at home.  #GoCanes there is no excuse.
Miami looks totally unprepared on both sides of the ball.  Deja vu all over again. #brokenrecord. #GoCanes

"I can't believe I missed so much of Kershaw's ""monkey off his back"" game.  #damnyoucnn"
Webb had a few moments that were quintessential Webb but most Dems learned more about how he disagrees with the base on a lot of issues
Not sure O'Malley did anything to change current trajectory of this race.  Can't easily see how he differentiates from Clinton or Sanders
Clinton showed most vulnerability on Wall Street regulation and the flip flop charges. Sanders showed vulnerability on guns &amp;foreign policy
Clinton was easily the most polished and prepped candidate on stage. Wasn't even close.  But Sanders isn't going anywhere. #NBC2016
Can we stop the stats in baseball games that confirm when a team is leading near the end of a game they are likely to win said game.

"@NKingofDC I have a one word answer for you ""Bernie"""
"@mateagold You need to quote him more accurately ""Soo-Per PAHC"""
"One thing Clinton has likely done tonight is calm her donors. She clearly prepared. Of course, Benghazi hearing may matter more to them"
Sanders might have an awkward debating style but he isn't doing anything to hurt himself with his base. #NBC2016
"So, basically, Chafee says any Senate votes that are 90+ in one direction don't really count as being significant to his record? #NBC2016"
@morningmoneyben thank you... Totally agree and the candidates weren't done talking about it
@HenryBarbour You referring to the former governor of RI?
"@TheFix Don't we all get a ""takeover""?"
"@BobShrum Read that tweet again. Did you ever think ""Glass-Stegall"" and ""unboring"" would be in the same tweet? (happen to agree w/you)"
"Sanders is giving an interesting rationale for why there should be free college education. The new ""high school"" diploma, he argues"
"Chafee just said what? Didnt know what he was voting for?vthink he was searching for either ""mulligan"" or ""do over"" but he went w/""takeover"""
Webb has GOT to stop sounding so whiny about time. Unbecoming #NBC2016
Wish there had been a follow to Sanders on his pledge that he would not have let the economy collapse. But what would he have done?
Clinton clearly is sensitive to the flip-flop issue. #NBC2016
"Sanders picks up on Clinton's 'I told Wall Street' to ""cut it out"" line and calls her naive. #NBC2016"
Sanders is now in his issue zone and seems a tad more comfortable getting into a tussle with Clinton. #NBC2016
"The fact that Clinton, Sanders and O'Malley have ALL changed their rhetoric on ""Black Lives Matter"" after encountering them on trail"
"Sanders, Clinton &amp; O'Malley, months ago, all went with the ""all lives matter"" answer when they first encountered ""Black Lives Matter"" mvment"
"Clinton gets opening to go after Sanders, she takes it (guns&amp; capitalism). Sanders gets opening to go after Clinton; he defends her #NBC2016"
"Wonder if Joe Biden is thinking, ""I may have to run simply to give Clinton a better debate sparring partner."" #NBC2016"
Webb gave most complete answer on the last Q before the commercial break. But not sure primary voters are watching for foreign policy 2night
Sanders made a funny... and yet he didn't smile! Sanders does seem to sensitive to this Commander in Chief charge #NBC2016
"This is why Webb ran for president, he wanted to push back at Clinton's foreign policy views. He's clearly comfortable w/the topic. #NBC2016"
"Clinton just reminded audience that Pres. Obama technically made the Libyan decision. Of course, Clinton was a BIG advocate"
Sanders is just not comfortable talking about foreign policy. #NBC2016
"Wonder if Sanders was slow on the response just now, wondering if he was supposed to respond to Webb and the South China Sea threat."
Clinton has not shied away from taking digs at her opponents. Sanders seems hesitant to do it. Wonder if that'll change tonight. #NBC2016
"If you wonder whether debate prep matters, just watch Clinton vs the rest of this Dem field tonight. Prepping matters. #NBC2016"
"Hmm, interesting decision by Clinton to try and use Obama as a shield on the Iraq War vote issue. #NBC2016"
"Jim Gilmore is wishing he decided to run as a Dem, he might have made a debate stage. #NBC2016"
Did we just go from guns to Russia? A little whiplashy
"So, if the NRA decided to endorse a candidate in the Dem primary, would they go with Sanders or Webb? Guessing Webb. #NBC2016"
Wonder if Webb will come to Sanders' defense. #NBC2016
"Now, O'Malley piles on Sanders for the gun manufacturing protection vote. Clinton happily nods. #NBC2016"
Clinton didn't waste time reminding Dems she is to the left of Sanders on at least one issue. Betting Sanders is surprised by her aggression
"Clinton campaign has to be pleased that the ""capitalism"" and guns issue are the opening issues. #NBC2016"
So Twitter would like to know if everyone has gotten their third person jokes off their Twitter chests
"Brutal way for O'Malley to introduce himself to the country, having to defend his record as mayor of Baltimore. #NBC2016"
So Clinton both took a subtle jab at Sanders over his capitalism answer and then gave him a lifeline
Clinton's experience on national debate stage just showed itself again. She defined capitalism in a way that Sanders ended up agreeing with
"Pretty tough Q from Cooper on the potential ""attack ad"" that GOP could write against Sanders. He avoided the specifics. #NBC2016"
"Clinton pivoted fairly well on the ""progressive v moderate"" Q though I'll be curious to hear how she would answer that Q if nominee #NBC2016"
So this isn't a debate yet; It is a series of individuals. #NBC2016
You can tell Hillary Clinton has done this before; Easily the most poised on stage so far. #NBC2016
"Sanders will want to watch how he plays on TV; there were times it felt like he was yelling. Great for rallies, not good for this stage"
"I like the 2 min. opening statements, especially for a FIRST debate. Gives you a decent condensed version of their stump speech. #NBC2016"
"Chafee Webb and O'Malley all have given opening statements designed to essentially say ""I'm progressive too! Maybe more than THEM!"""
"Chafee talks ""ethics,"" Webb starts with money in politics. #NBC2016"
Restraining myself to comment on ties. #NBC2016
"So this debate started at 8:48p, not 8:30p #NBC2016"
"So clearly, there is some false advertising going on. This debate has NOT started, you can now resume Mets-Dodgers watching"
"The GOP’s search for a speaker continues on Capitol Hill. @amyewalter and @costareports join me for The Lid, next on #MTPDaily."
"I’ll check in with the Clinton and Sanders campaigns to see how they are preparing for their first face off, next on #MTPDaily."

@HylianTom there have been a lot of odd variances in their party ID splits this cycle.
Clinton tried consistency with Iraq vote in 2008 and that didn't turn out well. So maybe that was among lessons learned for TPP and labor
@rolling_2 correct. Easier to be against. There isn't a strong organized pro-trade constituency in either party right now
Can someone state with confidence that TPP can get through this Congress? Seems like both parties have bases singing the anti-trade blues
Coming out against TPP has all the trappings of Clinton trying to placate labor and keep them from endorsing Sanders

"If Miami loses this game, there better be consequences.  Unacceptable #GoCanes"
Only this current iteration of the Miami program could let happen what is happening right now.  FINISH! #GoCanes
"Congrats officials, you gave Nebraska a chance. But it doesn't excuse Miami ONCE AGAIN having no 4thq Fire."
"Not sure what is frustrating me more, the horrendous officiating or the sloppy way Miami is finishing."
These officials need to stop trying to will Nebraska back into this game. Started with the wrong call on the catch. #GoCanes
These officials have decided to have an agenda here.  Ridiculous calls now. #gocanes
Very sloppy way for Miami to end this game. #GoCanes
Let's not fall into the old pattern of not finishing games.  #GoCanes
How many times do we have to fail at the fade before we stop calling it?  Hope the answer is 3.  #GoCanes
That's evidence of the ball bouncing our way. Love how the defense is playing today.  Aggressive.  Dare I say #swagger? #GoCanes

@loakman true but we've anticipated much of their game plan.  Right place right time in many cases.
Many of us fans have been tough on the D coaching. Let's give credit where it's due. Solid game plan today. #GoCanes
Big turnover for Miami. Makes up for the last two red zone hiccups.  #GoCanes This game could easily be 28-3 with better play calling
@NoPhotoOps predictable and stupid.
Two straight red zone trips for Miami where the play calling has been sub par.  #GoCanes
@jeffzeleny they don't believe yet. This turnout is a direct result of the frustration.  Win today will help.
@jeffzeleny they don't sell it in BigRed I hope!

@HotlineJosh Then as @stuartpstevens said everything we think we know about politics is wrong
Just realized we didn't hear from Carson much during foreign policy portion. Frontrunners need to engage on all topics. #NBC2016  #CNNDebate
That foreign policy portion was a reminder that it simply isn't Trump's best subject; may explain why he stayed quiet. #NBC2016 #CNNDebate

Definitely a different Scott Walker at tonight's debate. Seems much more engaged. #NBC2016 #CNNDebate
Kasich's Iran answer is one that Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton would have been comfortable giving. #NBC2016 #CNNDebate ditto Rand Paul

Neither Jindal nor Graham show much empathy for the arrest of the 14yo and now they are debating Kim Davis #NBC2016 #CNNDebate
Jindal should be thankful Tapper followed up so he could actually address whether a 14yo should have been a suspect. #NBC2016 #CNNDebate

Might as well watch this game on mute. Getting no info. How was that play not reviewed. Where's @MikePereira
@TheSilkLaser sure looked like it on that drive. Btw. Twice Crawford has failed to stop a big run from become bigger

This game is the Nats season in a nutshell.  Disappointing starter followed by bullpen disaster even as team gets enough key hits.

@FreddyRoo2 @msnbc @TheHRCSuperVols was serious observation.  Campaigns don't do teleprompters often for these events
Wow. the #blacklivesmatter movement has certainly had an impact on Clinton and Sanders. Both go out of way to talk about the movement
Sanders has his own powerful red meat filled riff for this crowd of IA Dems.  A unabashed progressive argument you won't hear from others
Speech important enough for Clinton campaign to make sure they had a TelePrompTer.  Clinton wanted to… https://t.co/EfNkagdf6x
Clinton just went into fierce defense over Benghazi and email server attacks.  Tells IA Dems it isn't serious just GOP playing politics
Hillary prepared a red meat speech for a crowd here in Clear Lake that is eating it up.  Speech is basically a long contrast with/ GOP field
"Clinton w/tougher Iran rhetoric than POTUS? ""We will never let you get a nuclear weapon. Not just for the terms of the agreement. never."""
"First issue Clinton talks about is Iran deal. Praises it and calls critics of the deal ""people of good faith""; different tone from POTUS"

Biden may end up not running but give him credit for teasing it a bit. Guess where he is vacationing for the next week: South Carolina
"Carson is very polite and isn't someone who pushes his way into conversations. That's great at a dinner party, bad in a debate with 9 alphas"
Christie might have been helped by Paul exchange but strong Kasich performance is not a good development for the NJGov
Walker didn't do anything poorly but at times he seemed to disappear.  Paul came across as almost too eager to combat.
Cruz didn't get as much on air time but he made the most of it. Don't sleep on Cruz in the conservative bracket.
Important performances for Rubio and Kasich.  Both needed to show they can stand out and they did. Bush had a few stumbles but got stronger
Jeb arguably just got Trump to acknowledge that Bush's criticism was legitimate on tone. Important moment for Bush
This is a big moment for Jeb Bush.  Let's see how Trump responds
Jeb Bush being put on defensive on Planned Parenthood.  Will be curious if he's asked if he would shut down Gov't over PP funding
Trump's been Trump. And so far that hasn't hurt him. Will it this time?

@ezraklein this has been the case all year. Whether in national polls or swing state surveys.  He over performs with indies

@randOmouz @TheFix u may be right.  The debates are THE incentive for some of these candidates
@LukeRussert @woodruffbets and what McConnell was in favor of in the late 90s during McCain-Feingold debate
@TheFix the fact that this is turning into bracketology shows that a national poll criteria is not good for the process

Thank you @BillyCorben for NOT going to tonight's Canes game at the Light.  Miami scores four runs in 1st inning.
@ErikWemple @DylanByers why I will always fight to be president of the @adamnagourney fan club. We all need to reminded of sourcing nonsense

"For many of you, @meetthepress starts in 15 minutes. For others, double check that you have DVR set."
To spend time anywhere near the Biden family is to know how tight knit of a unit they are. And Beau and his dad were inseparable. RIP Beau

@JDoran23 @TheFix strong contender. What about worst sequels not featuring Chevy chase
@TheFix it's the gap between good and bad that makes Fletch Lives so high on that worst sequel list.
