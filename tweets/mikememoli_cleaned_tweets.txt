So BernieSanders' tax return will be released on day he arrives at the Vatican. So we'll know how much he should tithe

Rubio: "Youre the only person on this stage thats ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally. 
Trump's response has nothing to do with policy, mentions Arpaio endorsement. Blitzer doesn't challenge for specifics. Will candidates?

"Did Donald Trump just suggest that genetically modified corn crops are addling Iowans brains? Kind of" 
"You didn't need my email address to get my attention," HillaryClinton says 
As TGowdySC and RepCummings (and RepAdamSchiff) squabble, camera shows a somewhat amused HillaryClinton rubbing her temples 
HillaryClinton, on Benghazi attacks: "I would imagine I've thought more about what happened than all of you put together." 
RepAdamSchiff devoting his Qamp;A time to offering what he says after the facts about Cmte's work, designed to politically wound Clinton 
That's Jim_Jordan, chair of the Freedom From Blazers Caucus 
HillaryClinton: Amb. Stevens "never said to anybody in the State Department, you know what, we just cant keep doing this." 
Team LAT  cvg here and here w/ evanhalper Noahbierman DavidLauter 
Interesting exchange btw Clinton amp; Duckworth, potential Dem nominee and candidate in key Senate race who'd benefit from strong top of ticket 
Clinton implicitly answers classification question in this particular email Q: the more serious the issue, more likely I dealt with hands-on 
To tough Q over low  of emails on Libya in 2012, HillaryClinton coolly responds: I did not conduct most business on email 
It is indeed game day for the greater Hillary-world Rapid Response teams 
Let record show that top Dem on Benghazi panel, RepCummings, uses DarrellIssa as Exhibit A of what he sees as false GOP charges on attack 
The Schmidt Scorecard! 
Just days after VP, HillaryClinton raises debate in Sit Room over going ahead w/bin Laden raid, mentions split among POTUS' advisers

Three years amp; change since their VP debate, here's Biden: And Ryan, via LisaMascaro 
Just watched VP's Rose Garden speech again, free of deadline pressure. What a fascinating political moment. 
And the Nats owners apparently have a strict don't-add-payroll-mid-season policy 
pkcapitol TheFix The lefty with no playoff credentials, or the righty? close call 
With starting pitching a big issue, it's a given Jordan Zimmermann is going to be a Cub next year, right? 
nielslesniewski Yes! I double-taked when I came across this old post of mine amid the VP-firefighters talk 
It's tick-tock o'clock. Lots of great reads tonight 
When ready, VP saw calling as middle class warrior, deal-maker. He even called Paul Ryan. But couldn't get to yes 
By the time VP was ready for the 2016 discussion it was too late. 
The thing about these past few months: just about every public comment VP made about his future, process proved true. 
The window is closing on the Cubs. Or something  
An editor kindly rounded up a summer's worth of my VP stories. What a long strange trip it's been 
Yes, this happened 
Matching ties? 
"I've concluded it has closed," VP says of the window to run for president 
What's interesting re: VP's jabs: Clinton about to face grilling from said "enemies," as troops rallying behind her 
(not a compliment) 
VP to Hillaryland: Don't put Biden in a corner 
The new goat?  
So the Mets are going to win the World Series. I'm not sure I am comfortable with that 
At the very least, VP is sending a strong signal to Hillaryland not to try and pressure him. You might not like the outcome 
If VP didn't just announce he was running, he gave a hell of a talking point to someone running against HillaryClinton 
Hello: VP says we need to "end this notion that the enemy is the other party." Calls it "naive" to think you can govern with that view 
VP says modern campaign finance system is "Inherently corrupting," and "undermines the middle class." "It is harder to generate trust." 
For first time today VP mentions HillaryClinton by name, repeating his earlier comment about foreign leaders knowing he spoke for POTUS 
Only 4 sitting VPs have been elected president. VP seems to have spent the day making case for why there should be a 5th 
VP breaks silence of his weekly lunch /POTUS, shares a bit of what they talked about today -- inspired by the Mondale a.m. event 
VP says he's told he's now taken 8,200 round trips to Wilmington, Delaware. (Maybe he'll announce again at what's now the Biden Station) 
VP says part of the job of a VP is to "be prepared to jump in front of the bus" for the POTUS. "Thats your job. Thats a requirement." 
VP, on Carter giving Mondale real power as VP: "Your decision helped future presidents." 
VP thanks Carter for understanding how a VP could "enhance and consequentially impact" a president's duties, responsibilities. 
VP of Pres. Carter: I am confident that now a new generation of Americans understands just how much character you have 
VP opens remarks by saying he was first person outside state of Georgia to endorse President Carter, campaigned for him across the country 
Update: the vice presidential seal is on the lectern. I repeat: the vice presidential seal is on the lectern. 
Pres. Carter says he never goes abroad w/o permission from the WH. "Sometimes reluctant permission. But I always get permission." 
President Carter says he met with JohnKerry today to discuss the Iran nuclear deal 
ZekeJMiller this is why you have text alerts 
JOE BIDEN sending the signals that he WILL run for president. But talking through what it will take ... 
Carter on Mondale: "So far as I know he was almost like another president. That's what I wanted." 
Maybe I'll point out lectern VP speaking from at Mondale dinner doesn't have VP seal on it at moment. Usually done when event is political 
VP speculation threw curveball at HHHSchool, running Mondale events he's attending. Credit to staff for dealing with frenzied press corps 
POTUS has phoned soon-to-be Canadian PM Trudeau, WH says 
Tuesday we saw what happens when VP's political interest diverges from POTUS' 
HillaryClinton has Katy Perry in Iowa for pre-JJ rally. MartinOMalley has, well, Martin O'Malley 
PressSec: This is not first time people have offered "differing recollections" of a significant moment like the OBL raid. 
PressSec won't address VP's fresh account of OBL raid. I'll leave the dissection and the oral history "to those who were actually there." 
dsupervilleap says the 4-7 hrs VP says he spends /POTUS is a lot of time to spend w/1 person. PressSec asks: true of AP WH booth, too? 
PressSec says he expects POTUS will call new Canadian PM today, and likely speak to outgoing PM Harper as well in near future 
PressSec promises to speed along the briefing with a 4pm first pitch for his Royals against the Blue Jays looming 
The Sit Room scene VP described "absolutely accurate. Thats exactly what happened." 
VP: "It's hard to serve in this office if you don't genuinely, genuinely respect the judgment and character of the president." 
Advice for next VP? VP: "Make sure before you accept the office there is clear understanding of what the president expects of you." 
Odometer update: VP says he's now traveled almost 1,100,000 miles 
Mondale: Obama/Biden administration is solidifying the merger of the presidential and vice presidential institutions. 
VP on relationship /POTUS: "He knew what he was getting and I knew what I was getting. There was no pretense about it" 
VP says ideologically, he and POTUS "have had no disagreement. None. I mean zero." But adds: "Weve had tactical disagreements." 
VP: The Cheney-Bush relationship at the outset more co-dependent. But "appeared he had lost President Bushs confidence at the end." 
VP calls Cheney "decent man." Says he was "extremely helpful and gracious about the office, and the legal parameters of the office" 
VP gushing about Hubert Humphrey, whom he calls his mentor. That Happy Warrior approach might guide a campaign 
Just didn't get enough time. 
VP on culture of Hill now: "Its about what people think your motive is... You cant get to yes after I tell you I think youre dishonest" 
At times watching this VP event, it seems he might as well be using that CNN podium afterall, a week after the fact 
VP clarifies his view on OBL raid: he didn't want to take position before full Cabinet, told POTUS personally he thought he should go 
Contra HillaryClinton account, VP says only two Cabinet members were definitive about OBL raid: Panetta yes, Gates no 
VP: "Weve had two great secretaries of state. But when I go [overseas] they know I am speaking for the president." 
VP: Going to Hill a good use of my time. "I dont think my chief enemy is the Republican Party. This is a matter of making things work." 
VP: I spend between, depending on the season, 4 to 7 hours a day, every day with the president. 
Translation: he signed off on HillaryClinton 
VP: I didnt mean it figuratively, I meant it literally: I wanted to be the last guy in the room 
VP on he amp; POTUS: "We have a great trust in one another." Adds: "At least half of the presidents staff were my former staff members." 
VP: "I warned the president: when he got me he got the whole family. He thought I was kidding." 
VP: Mondale was big help to me, his wife big help to Jill in her "very difficult job. Its almost demeaning, the title: second lady. 
VP said he first told Obama he thought he could help him more as chairman of Foreign Relations Cmte than as VP. 
VP: I told Obama I didn't want to be VP, but family convinced me to join ticket. It was "best decision of my political career" 
Mondale: key development was giving VP office in West Wing. Jokes that going to the EEOB "was like going to Baltimore" 
Today in VP watch: much will be made into the exchanges of these two VPs, Mondale amp; Biden 
"Unfortunately it was a Constitutional afterthought," Mondale's former chief of staff says of the vice presidency 
Stroman for PM 
Dunno. Gets in the A-block if there's a "How does this affect Biden" angle

"The government is not the answer," VP says of climate solutions. But it can "kick start" them 
"Denial is not a luxury for those of us responsible for governing," VP says at climate event

Does POTUS want PRyan as speaker? "The president doesn't have a rooting interest in this one," PressSec says 
PressSec: Even if VP were to run, he'd "make time as necessary for the responsibilities he currently has." Notes he handled in '12, too

PressSec says he doesn't know if VP has told POTUS about a 2016 decision. Intrigue is not major focus of West Wing. 
"Man, if I had a dollar for every story about what VP was going to do and when he'd do it" -- MartinOMalley, probably 
What we know about VP's schedule tomorrow: he gives a speech on "The Mondale Vice Presidency And Its Legacy."

POTUS said Dem debate took place at same time as some MLB postseason games. So there was some channel surfing

HillaryClinton plays up Democratic unity on immigration reform in contrast with GOP position  
"Enough with the emails!" BernieSanders booms. "Lets talk about the real issues facing America." Clinton offers an approving handshake 
And there you go: after absorbing hit, HillaryClinton responds by thanking GovernorOMalley for his strong support in her '08 campaign 
Interesting gamesmanship from MartinOMalley: align w/Clinton to go after Sanders on guns; align w/Sanders to go after Clinton on Iraq 
First VP dig from HillaryClinton? Notes she was one of few advisers who backed bin Laden raid  
Fascinating: HillaryClinton answers Iraq vote charge by essentially saying POTUS endorsed her judgment by naming her sec/state  
Raise your hand if you thought the first multi-candidate pile-on would be against BernieSanders  
Now that's a picture: GovernorOMalley making emotional case on guns to contrast /BernieSanders, as HillaryClinton nods along  
. HillaryClinton has consistently passed up opportunities to draw contrasts /BernieSanders on trail, interviews. Not tonight  
Is BernieSanders tough enough on guns? "No, not at all," HillaryClinton says  
BernieSanders asked about vote for '05 law that protects gun dealers from lawsuits. HillaryClinton voted against, just proposed repealing 
GovernorOMalley: "None of this is easy. None of us has all the answers" But cites "leadership" in Baltimore in tough situation  
No surprise here: first question for GovernorOMalley is about the "unrest" in Baltimore 
Shrewd comment from HillaryClinton contrasting with Sanders: When I think of capitalism I think of small businesses  
HilllaryClinton says she's traveled country, listened, and as a result "put forward specific plans" to get "more good-paying jobs." 
GovernorOMalley summarizes the issues that have largely been driving Dem race, especially what he calls "economic injustice"

Chafee starts with bio -- only candidate who was mayor, governor, senator -- but includes veiled shot at Clinton on Iraq war vote

GovChristie: haven't given DC representation in Congress much thought. But "initial gut reaction": It won't help or make difference 
GovChristie still doesn't care about who speaker is. "I'm bored. I think you are, too," with "bickering over things nobody cares about"
