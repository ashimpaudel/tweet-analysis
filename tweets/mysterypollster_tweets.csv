"@MattDabrowski Of course not.  But let's not pretend that not having the confidence to call something a lead is a ""tie"""
"For the record, I'm not a fan of ""statistical tie."" Dear followers, what's your take?"
"@cmatthewspolls It's actually been available (via gmail's underused ""labs"" features) for years. Has saved me many, many times."
"Another 16.9% of adults are “cell mostly” (have both, answer most calls on cell phone); so 61% are cell only/mostly http://t.co/YVbnu2tPo1"

CASRO &amp; MRA express disappointment at the FCC’s vote to expand to TCPA http://t.co/AuSeGS0GbG’s-june-18-tcpa-vote
@WinthropPoll @KSoltisAnderson We need to see full rules to be certain of what’s “in the clear”
@WinthropPoll @KSoltisAnderson Might not be if you use preview dialing for cells or if your phone equipment could be modified to “autodial
"@KSoltisAnderson @WinthropPoll Live caller is ok if they manually dial a “rotary” phone. Open Q, pending rules, is how much automation is ok"
@davemitrani Nope. No TCPA exemptions for “political” calls to cell phones. That’s just do-not-dial.
"Full text of new FCC rules not yet published, but a chill wind blows for pollsters in Commissioner comments http://t.co/oaEjzsH1c8"
"HuffPollster: FCC tightens restrictions on cell calls, yet omitting cells makes polls less accurate. Isn't it ironic? http://t.co/oaEjzsH1c8"
@Opinion_Savvy Not yet. Most I’m talking to want to see the actual regs
@kwcollins No. Actual regs not posted yet

"The FCC’s press release on new, stronger regulations against “unwanted calls &amp; texts” https://t.co/CbyZWvFNOe"
One takeaway on what FCC just did: Though some discussion of “sensible exceptions” the words “survey” or “poll” were never spoken
Looks like the FCC meeting will turn to its news on TCPA &amp; “robocalls” shortly. Live stream here: https://t.co/E54CNnifMY

"Automated dialing is very important to efficiency (i.e. costs) and accuracy, but you don’t need automation to dial a random sample &lt;/rant&gt;"
Put another way: Don’t confuse “random digit dial” sampling with automated dialing. All they have in common is the word “dial.”
One thing I’ve seen confused in some accounts: “autodialers” have no role in survey sampling or the “science” of surveys. None. Zip. Nada.

"Keep in mind, Fenty won 44% citywide in 2014, so Bowser 48% early vote in pcts 1-84 vs Fenty’s 51 total is good news for her"
Caution!! Early vote precincts counted so far are 1-84. Overall these precincts favored FENTY 51-48 in 2010. Grey won missing pcts 66-33
"Caution on making too much of the early vote count. Per @JoeLenski &amp; @jeremybowers, appears to be missing all of Ward 8 &amp; more"

2/2 Will be several updates over next 90 mins as they get all interviews and adjust for within-precinct-error. Accuracy jumps as they do.
1/2 The reason nets won’t call on a 7 point e.p. margin is they’re waiting to check errors against actual count in selected precincts…
2) Similarity of margin (+7) to poll averages may be for good reason. See “To try to minimize” graph here http://t.co/foRCIMwaDR
Two things… 1) Note that a 7 point margin in the exit poll estimate is *not* enough to call the election…by any network
"CNN once again sharing topline estimate “@JuddLegum: CNN Exit Polls: McAulliffe 50%, Cuccinelli 43%, Sarvis 7% (via @SamFeistCNN)”"
".@TheFix @AaronBlakeWP In fairness, NEP did better at anticipating/correcting any early error in 2012...but always best to wait"
"Reminder: the @HuffPostData 2013 elections results page will have counts on all races, a map &amp; scatter plot for VA http://t.co/bULmDnGbFC"
Yep “@kwcollins: Do the exit poll MOEs account for the cluster sample design effect?”
Probably worth checking my exit poll piece from 2012 http://t.co/FWVJs1veht Or even 2004 http://t.co/Wt90StR6oo

"@amyrchapman @Nate_Cohn Depends on the state. If the early/absentee % is likely to be significant, they usually do."
"@amyrchapman @Nate_Cohn Actually, I believe they’ve done a phone poll for early/absentee."
@RyanODonnellPA @PostPolls You might recall early exit poll data in 2004...President Kerry?

@bwbensonjr @skoczela Thanks. The old machines of Boston &amp; Chicago are gone but these mid-day turnout #s are their one nice legacy.
"@skoczela For those of us unfamiliar with the Ward geography, which candidate benefits from a higher turnout in wards 16 &amp; 18?"
.@DaveAHopkins @monkeycageblog Who needs anecdotal turnout reports when we have early vote count from @ElectProject? http://t.co/3OXt2IYhKY
"Wow. Great hire. Congrats Carl! “@fivethirtyeight: Exciting news: 538 is hiring @CarlBialik, aka the WSJ's ""Numbers Guy""”"
@LoganDobson Got it. Agree. So rare to get something truly qualitative on election day.
@LoganDobson ok...so what’s your point?
Note @ElectProject’s key takeaway:  VA early vote says “polls are likely correct in predicting a McAuliffe lead” http://t.co/NKYSgijuwJ

@ElectProject @ForecasterEnten @TerryMcAuliffe These are #s of votes cast? And what leads you to that conclusion?
@ForecasterEnten Thanks (sent prior tweet before seeing this)
"@ForecasterEnten Close, but not quite. See paragraph 3 http://t.co/Hh13llg5js"
"@Nate_Cohn @monkeycageblog A worry of mine too.  Confidence of win harder to do, but we’re working on it."
@letsgokath Yes. Piece describes *public* polls. Mellman’s good work was held private. Are VA’s internal polls different too? We don’t know.

"@skoczela @dbernstein Can send more later, but...to the extent that there’s a house effect, we dial it back. Harder with fewer polls"
".@skoczela @dbernstein Remember, a 56% probability of lead is teeny bit better than a 50/50 coin-flip. A true “toss-up.”"
