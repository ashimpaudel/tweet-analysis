The counterargument is that a one-year funding increase isn't worth permanent rollback of Dodd-Frank and campaign finance rules.
"Those were worked out by House Rs and Senate Ds during the negotiations, and Dems would lose that leverage in next Congress."
"If Cromnibus falls apart &amp; there's a 3-month stopgap, it would erase new funding secured for NIH, Ebola, FDA, NIH, veterans, SEC, CFTC."

"The broader point is that consumer expenditures continued to rise in a bad quarter, though it wasn't enough to overcome the negatives."
"On its face, it's unclear whether more spending on health care is ""good"" or ""bad,"" broadly speaking. But it has a real economic impact."
...particularly when there's so much misinformation out their about the ACA's impact so far. The long-term macro impact remains to be seen.
Boosting GDP for one quarter is not a argument *for* the ACA of course. But we shouldn't ignore its actual impact on the economy...
World War II ended 69 years ago. The fact that Congress has any WWII veterans left is pretty astounding.
